	abstract = {In plants, reactive oxygen species and, more particularly, hydrogen peroxide ({H2O2)} play a dual role as toxic by-products of normal cell metabolism and as regulatory molecules in stress perception and signal
         transduction. Peroxisomal catalases are an important sink for photorespiratory {H2O2.} Using {ATH1} Affymetrix microarrays, expression profiles were compared between control and catalase-deficient Arabidopsis
         (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Reduced catalase levels already provoked differences in nuclear gene expression under ambient growth conditions,
         and these effects were amplified by high light exposure in a sun simulator for 3 and 8 h. This genome-wide expression analysis
         allowed us to reveal the expression characteristics of complete pathways and functional categories during {H2O2} stress. In total, 349 transcripts were significantly up-regulated by high light in catalase-deficient plants and 88 were
         down-regulated. From this data set, {H2O2} was inferred to play a key role in the transcriptional up-regulation of small heat shock proteins during high light stress.
         In addition, several transcription factors and candidate regulatory genes involved in {H2O2} transcriptional gene networks were identified. Comparisons with other publicly available transcriptome data sets of abiotically
         stressed Arabidopsis revealed an important intersection with {H2O2-deregulated} genes, positioning elevated {H2O2} levels as an important signal within abiotic stress-induced gene expression. Finally, analysis of transcriptional changes
         in a combination of a genetic (catalase deficiency) and an environmental (high light) perturbation identified a transcriptional
         cluster that was strongly and rapidly induced by high light in control plants, but impaired in catalase-deficient plants.
         This cluster comprises the complete known anthocyanin regulatory and biosynthetic pathway, together with genes encoding unknown
         proteins.},

	abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

Superoxide dismutase ({SOD)} activity was assayed on gels, and the expression of six {SOD} genes was studied using real-time {PCR.} Mean growth rate was increased in high light ({HL)} regime as compared to low light ({LL)} regime. Parallely, most of {SOD} genes were overexpressed in Col and underexpressed in N1438 in response to {HL.} At 50 {mM} {NaCl}, plant growth was inhibited and a complex pattern of {SOD} gene expression was recorded. These responses varied according to the light regime, and differed between the accessions. This pattern, including the differences between the accessions, could be interpreted as a consequence of interaction between light and salt, hypothesizing that oxidative stress occurred when light energy input exceeded energy utilization when salt inhibited growth, and that oxidative stress induced overexpression of some {SOD} genes. Salt-induced excess Na+ accumulation in leaves and limitation of K+ provision to these organs might also participate in eliciting {SOD} genes’ response. Variability was observed between the two accessions for all these traits.},

Analysis of metabolite profiles revealed significant changes upon treatment in aox1a plants typical of combined stress treatments, and these were less pronounced or absent in Col-0 plants. These changes were accompanied by alteration in the abundance of a variety of transcripts during the stress treatment, providing a molecular fingerprint for the stress-induced phenotype of aox1a plants. Transcripts encoding proteins involved in the synthesis of anthocyanins, transcription factors, chloroplastic and mitochondrial components, cell wall synthesis, and sucrose and starch metabolism changed, indicating that effects were not confined to mitochondria, where the {AOX1a} protein is located. Microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that transcripts typically induced upon stress treatment or involved in antioxidant defense systems, especially chloroplast-located antioxidant defense components, had altered basal levels in untreated aox1a plants, suggesting a significant change in the basal equilibrium of signaling pathways that regulate these components. Taken together, these results indicate that aox1a plants have a greatly altered stress response even when mitochondria or the mitochondrial electron transport chain are not the primary target of the stress and that {AOX1a} plays a broad role in determining the normal redox balance in the cell.},

	doi = {10.1093/jxb/erj029},
	abstract = {The subject of this review is the impact of long-term changes in temperature on plant growth and its underlying components. The discussion highlights the extent to which thermal acclimation of metabolism is intrinsically linked to the plasticity of a range of biochemical and morphological traits. The fact that there is often a trade-off between temperature-mediated changes in net assimilation rates ({NAR)} and biomass allocation [in particular the specific leaf area ({SLA)]} when plants are grown at different temperatures is also highlighted. Also discussed is the role of temperature-mediated changes in photosynthesis and respiration in determining {NAR} values. It is shown that in comparisons that do not take phylogeny into account, fast-growing species exhibit greater temperature-dependent changes in {RGR}, {SLA}, and {NAR} than slow-growing plants. For {RGR} and {NAR}, such trends are maintained within phylogenetically independent contrasts (i.e. species adapted to more-favourable habitats consistently exhibit greater temperature-mediated changes than their congeneric counterparts adapted to less-favourable habitats). By contrast, {SLA} was not consistently more thermally plastic in species from favourable habitats. Interestingly, biomass allocation between leaves and roots was consistently more plastic in slow-growing species within individual phylogenetically independent contrasts, when plants were grown under contrasting temperatures. Finally, how interspecific variations in {NAR} account for an increasing proportion of variability in {RGR} as growth temperatures decrease is highlighted. Conversely, {SLA} played a more dominant role in determining interspecific variability in {RGR} at higher growth temperatures; thus, the importance of {SLA} in determining interspecific variation in {RGR} could potentially increase if annual mean temperatures increase in the future.},

	abstract = {Several proteins of photosystem {II} ({PSII)} and its light-harvesting antenna ({LHCII)} are reversibly phosphorylated according to light quantity and quality. Nevertheless, the interdependence of protein phosphorylation, nonphotochemical quenching, and efficiency of electron transfer in the thylakoid membrane has remained elusive. These questions were addressed by investigating in parallel the wild type and the stn7, stn8, and stn7 stn8 kinase mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), using the stn7 npq4, npq4, npq1, and pgr5 mutants as controls. Phosphorylation of {PSII-LHCII} proteins is strongly and dynamically regulated according to white light intensity. Yet, the changes in phosphorylation do not notably modify the relative excitation energy distribution between {PSII} and {PSI}, as typically occurs when phosphorylation is induced by “state 2” light that selectively excites {PSII} and induces the phosphorylation of both the {PSII} core and {LHCII} proteins. On the contrary, under low-light conditions, when excitation energy transfer from {LHCII} to reaction centers is efficient, the {STN7-dependent} {LHCII} protein phosphorylation guarantees a balanced distribution of excitation energy to both photosystems. The importance of this regulation diminishes at high light upon induction of thermal dissipation of excitation energy. Lack of the {STN7} kinase, and thus the capacity for equal distribution of excitation energy to {PSII} and {PSI}, causes relative overexcitation of {PSII} under low light but not under high light, leading to disturbed maintenance of fluent electron flow under fluctuating light intensities. The physiological relevance of the {STN7-dependent} regulation is evidenced by severely stunted phenotypes of the stn7 and stn7 stn8 mutants under strongly fluctuating light conditions.},

	abstract = {In a plant's natural environment, the intensity of light can change rapidly due to sunflecks, cloudiness and intermittent shading. Fluctuations between high and low illumination phases expose the photosynthetic machinery to rapidly changing signals that can be overlapping or contradictory, and accordingly plants have developed astute acclimation strategies to maintain optimal photosynthetic performance in these conditions. Continuous exposure to high light induces an array of protective mechanisms at anatomical, chemical and molecular levels, but when high light phases are short, such as under fluctuating light conditions, the protective strategies that afford protection to constant high light are not employed by plants. One mechanism that is engaged under both constant and fluctuating high light is the photosynthetic control of the Cyt b 6f complex, which prevents hyper-reduction of the electron transfer chain in order to protect {PSI} from photodamage. The {PGR5} protein was recently shown to play an indispensable role in this protective mechanism. This review revisits the findings of earlier studies into photosynthetic control and places {PGR5} within the broader context of photoprotection and light acclimation strategies.},

For many genes, variation in expression could be explained by expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs).} The nature and consequences of this variation are discussed based on additional genetic parameters, such as heritability and transgression and by examining the genomic position of {eQTLs} versus gene position, polymorphism frequency, and gene ontology. Furthermore, we developed an approach for genetic regulatory network construction by combining {eQTL} mapping and regulator candidate gene selection. The power of our method was shown in a case study of genes associated with flowering time, a well studied regulatory network in Arabidopsis. Results that revealed clusters of coregulated genes and their most likely regulators were in agreement with published data, and unknown relationships could be predicted.},

	abstract = {A conserved regulatory mechanism protects plants against the potentially damaging effects of excessive light. Nearly all photosynthetic eukaryotes are able to dissipate excess absorbed light energy in a process that involves xanthophyll pigments. To dissect the role of xanthophylls in photoprotective energy dissipation in vivo, we isolated Arabidopsis xanthophyll cycle mutants by screening for altered nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. The npq1 mutants are unable to convert violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in excessive light, whereas the npq2 mutants accumulate zeaxanthin constitutively. The npq2 mutants are new alleles of aba1, the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene. The high levels of zeaxanthin in npq2 affected the kinetics of induction and relaxation but not the extent of nonphotochemical quenching. Genetic mapping, {DNA} sequencing, and complementation of npq1 demonstrated that this mutation affects the structural gene encoding violaxanthin deepoxidase. The npq1 mutant exhibited greatly reduced nonphotochemical quenching, demonstrating that violaxanthin deepoxidation is required for the bulk of rapidly reversible nonphotochemical quenching in Arabidopsis. Altered regulation of photosynthetic energy conversion in npq1 was associated with increased sensitivity to photoinhibition. These results, in conjunction with the analysis of npq mutants of Chlamydomonas, suggest that the role of the xanthophyll cycle in nonphotochemical quenching has been conserved, although different photosynthetic eukaryotes rely on the xanthophyll cycle to different extents for the dissipation of excess absorbed light energy.},

	abstract = {When low-light-grown Arabidopsis rosettes are partially exposed to excess light ({EL)}, the unexposed leaves become acclimated to excess excitation energy ({EEE)} and consequent photo-oxidative stress. This phenomenon, termed systemic acquired acclimation ({SAA)}, is associated with redox changes in the proximity of photosystem {II}, changes in foliar {H2O2} content and induction of antioxidant defences. The induction of extra-plastidial antioxidant systems is important in the protection of the chloroplast under {EL} conditions. A larger range of transcripts encoding different antioxidant defence enzymes may be induced in the systemically acclimated leaves and these include those encoded by the glutathione peroxidase ({GPX2)} and glutathione-S-transferase ({GST)} genes, which are also highly induced in the hypersensitive response and associated systemic acquired resistance ({SAR)} in incompatible plant-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, the expression of the {SAR-inducible} pathogenesis-related protein gene, {PR2}, is enhanced in {SAA} leaves. Wounded leaf tissue also shows enhanced systemic induction of a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase gene ({APX2)} under {EL} conditions. These and other considerations, suggest {H2O2} and other reactive oxygen species ({ROS)} could be the common factor in signalling pathways for diverse environmental stresses. These effects may be mediated by changes in the level and redox state of the cellular glutathione pool. Mutants with constitutive expression of a normally {EL-inducible} {APX2} gene have much reduced levels of foliar glutathione. The expression of {APX1} and {APX3}, encoding cytosolic and peroxisome-associated isoforms, respectively, are also under phytochrome-A-mediated control. The expression of these genes is tightly linked to the greening of plastids in etiolated seedlings. These data suggest that part of the developmental processes that bring about the acclimation of leaves to high light includes the configuration of antioxidant defences. Therefore, the linkage between immediate responses of leaves to {EL}, acclimation of chloroplasts to {EEE} and the subsequent changes to leaf form and function in high light could be mediated by the activity of foliar antioxidant defences and changes in the concentration of {ROS.}},

By dramatically extending the number of unique, reproducible genomes, {RIXs} share some of the best properties of both the parental {RI} and F2 mapping panels. These attributes make the {RIX} method ideally suited for experiments requiring analysis of multiple parameters, under different environmental conditions and/or temporal sampling. However, since any pair of {RIX} genomes shares either one or no parental {RIs}, this cross introduces an unusual population structure requiring special computational approaches for analysis. Herein, we propose an efficient statistical procedure for {QTL} mapping with {RIXs} and describe a novel empirical permutation procedure to assess genome-wide significance. This procedure will also be applicable to diallel crosses. Extensive simulations using strain distribution patterns from {CXB}, {AXB/BXA}, and {BXD} mouse {RI} lines show the theoretical power of the {RIX} approach and the analysis of {CXB} {RIXs} demonstrates the limitations of this procedure when using small {RI} panels.},

	abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from {RNA-Seq} gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between {RNA} samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the {edgeR} package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods ({GLMs)} to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of {GLMs} to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from {DNA-Seq} applications, including {ChIP-Seq} for epigenetic marks and {DNA} methylation analyses.},

Our growth chambers were set to simulate the spring conditions in Spain and Sweden, with appropriate changes in light color, intensity and day length, as well as temperature and relative humidity. Thus the Sweden-like spring conditions changed more dramatically compared to Spain-like spring conditions across the duration of our experiment. We have used these conditions to map {QTL} responsible for flowering time in the Kas-{1/Col-gl1} recombinant inbred lines ({RILs)} across two replicate blocks. A linkage map from 96 {RILs} was established using 119 markers including 64 new {SNPs} markers. One major {QTL}, mapping to the {FRIGIDA} ({FRI)} locus, was detected on the top of chromosome 4 that showed significant gene×seasonal environment interactions. Three other minor {QTL} also were detected. One {QTL} mapping near {FLOWERING} {LOCUS} M ({FLM)} showed an epistatic interaction with the {QTL} at {FRI.} These {QTL×environment} and {QTL×QTL} interactions suggest that subtle ecologically relevant changes in light, temperature, and relative humidity are differentially felt by alleles controlling flowering time and may be responsible for adaptation to regional environments.},

We previously reported that the heritable {eQTL} patterns are highly dynamic with age in an N2 × {CB4856} recombinant inbred population of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, we showed that the number of {eQTL} decreased with age. Here, we investigated the reason for this decrease by combining gene expression profiles at three ages in the wild types N2 and {CB4856} with the reported expression profiles of the {RIL} population. We determined heritability and transgression (when gene expression levels in the {RILs} are more extreme than the parents) and investigated their relation with {eQTL} changes with age. Transgressive segregation was widespread but depended on physiological age. The percentage of genes with an {eQTL} increased with a higher heritability in young worms. However, for old worms this percentage hardly increased. Using a single marker approach, we found that almost 20\% of genes with heritability {\textgreater}0.9 had an {eQTL} in developing worms. Surprisingly, only 10\% was found in old worms. Using a multimarker approach, this percentage increased to almost 30\% for both age groups. Comparison of the single marker to a multiple marker {eQTL} mapping indicated that heritable regulation of gene expression becomes more polygenic in aging worms due to multiple loci and possible epistatic interactions. We conclude that linkage studies should account for the relation between increased polygenic regulation and diminished effects at older ages.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Messenger {RNA} expression is important in normal development and differentiation, as well as in manifestation of disease. {RNA-seq} experiments allow for the identification of differentially expressed ({DE)} genes and their corresponding isoforms on a genome-wide scale. However, statistical methods are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made. A number of methods exist for identifying {DE} genes, but far fewer are available for identifying {DE} isoforms. When isoform {DE} is of interest, investigators often apply gene-level (count-based) methods directly to estimates of isoform counts. Doing so is not recommended. In short, estimating isoform expression is relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms, but more challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty that varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty and consequently application of them for isoform inference results in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased false discoveries for others.
Results: Taking advantage of the merits of empirical Bayesian methods, we have developed {EBSeq} for identifying {DE} isoforms in an {RNA-seq} experiment comparing two or more biological conditions. Results demonstrate substantially improved power and performance of {EBSeq} for identifying {DE} isoforms. {EBSeq} also proves to be a robust approach for identifying {DE} genes.

	abstract = {In higher plants, the photosystem ({PS)} {II} core and its several light harvesting antenna ({LHCII)} proteins undergo reversible phosphorylation cycles according to the light intensity. High light intensity induces strong phosphorylation of the {PSII} core proteins and suppresses the phosphorylation level of the {LHCII} proteins. Decrease in light intensity, in turn, suppresses the phosphorylation of {PSII} core, but strongly induces the phosphorylation of {LHCII.} Reversible and differential phosphorylation of the {PSII-LHCII} proteins is dependent on the interplay between the {STN7} and {STN8} kinases, and the respective phosphatases. The {STN7} kinase phosphorylates the {LHCII} proteins and to a lesser extent also the {PSII} core proteins D1, D2 and {CP43.} The {STN8} kinase, on the contrary, is rather specific for the {PSII} core proteins. Mechanistically, the {PSII-LHCII} protein phosphorylation is required for optimal mobility of the {PSII-LHCII} protein complexes along the thylakoid membrane. Physiologically, the phosphorylation of {LHCII} is a prerequisite for sufficient excitation of {PSI}, enabling the excitation and redox balance between {PSII} and {PSI} under low irradiance, when excitation energy transfer from the {LHCII} antenna to the two photosystems is efficient and thermal dissipation of excitation energy ({NPQ)} is minimised. The importance of {PSII} core protein phosphorylation is manifested under highlight when the photodamage of {PSII} is rapid and phosphorylation is required to facilitate the migration of damaged {PSII} from grana stacks to stroma lamellae for repair. The importance of thylakoid protein phosphorylation is highlighted under fluctuating intensity of light where the {STN7} kinase dependent balancing of electron transfer is a prerequisite for optimal growth and development of the plant.

A major challenge in inferring {eQTL} is that a number of factors, such as unobserved covariates, experimental artifacts, and unknown environmental perturbations, may confound the observed expression levels. This may both mask real associations and lead to spurious association findings.
Results: In this paper, we introduce a {LOw-Rank} representation to account for confounding factors and make use of Sparse regression for {eQTL} mapping ({LORS).} We integrate the low-rank representation and sparse regression into a unified framework, in which {SNPs} and gene probes can be jointly analyzed. Given the two model parameters, our formulation is a convex optimization problem. We have developed an efficient algorithm to solve this problem and its convergence is guaranteed. We demonstrate its ability to account for non-genetic effects using simulation, and then apply it to two independent real data sets. Our results indicate that {LORS} is an effective tool to account for non-genetic effects. First, our detected associations show higher consistency between studies than recently proposed methods. Second, we have identified some new hot spots which can not be identified without accounting for non-genetic effects.

	abstract = {Phosphorylation of the major photosynthetic light harvesting antenna proteins by {STN7} kinase balances excitation between {PSII} and {PSI.} Phosphorylation of such abundant proteins is unique, differing distinctively from conventional tasks of protein kinases in phosphorylation of low abundance proteins in signaling cascades. Excitation balance between {PSII} and {PSI} is critical for redox homeostasis between the plastoquinone and plastocyanin pools and {PSI} electron acceptors, determining the capacity of the thylakoid membrane to produce reactive oxygen species ({ROS)} that operate as signals relaying information between chloroplasts and other cellular compartments. {STN7} has also been proposed to be a conventional signaling kinase, instigating the phosphorylation cascade required for coordinated expression of photosynthesis genes and assembly of the photosynthetic machinery. The absence of {STN7} kinase, however, does not prevent plants from sensing redox imbalance and adjusting the stoichiometry of the photosynthetic machinery to restore redox homeostasis. This suggests that {STN7} is not essential for signaling between the chloroplast and the nucleus. Here we discuss the evolution and functions of the {STN7} and other thylakoid protein kinases and phosphatases, and the inherent difficulties in analyzing signaling cascades initiated from the photosynthetic machinery. Based on our analyses of literature and publicly available expression data, we conclude that {STN7} exerts it signaling effect primarily by controlling chloroplast {ROS} homeostasis through maintaining steady-state phosphorylation of the light harvesting {II} proteins and the redox balance in the thylakoid membrane. {ROS} are important signaling molecules with a direct effect on the development of jasmonate, which in turn relays information out from the chloroplast. We propose that thylakoid membrane redox homeostasis, regulated by {SNT7}, sends cell-wide signals that reprogram the entire hormonal network in the cell.},

Plants have mechanisms to enhance the capture of energy when light is limited for growth and development. Also, when energy is in excess, the photosynthetic machinery slows down the electron transfer reactions in order to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species and the consequent damage of the photosynthetic machinery. In this opinion paper, we present a partially hypothetical scheme describing how the photosynthetic machinery controls the flow of energy and electrons in order to enable the maintenance of photosynthetic activity in nature under continual fluctuations in white light intensity. We discuss the roles of light-harvesting {II} protein phosphorylation, thermal dissipation of excess energy and the control of electron transfer by cytochrome b6f, and the role of dynamically regulated turnover of photosystem {II} in the maintenance of the photosynthetic machinery. We present a new hypothesis suggesting that most of the regulation in the thylakoid membrane occurs in order to prevent oxidative damage of photosystem I.},

The focus is on photoprotection via the safe removal – as thermal energy – of excess solar energy absorbed by the light collecting system, which counteracts the formation of reactive oxygen species. An update on the surprisingly complex, multiple variations of thermal energy dissipation is presented, placing these different forms into ecological and genetic contexts. Zeaxanthin-facilitated, flexible thermal dissipation associated with the {PsbS} protein and controlled by the trans-thylakoid {pH} gradient apparently occurs ubiquitously in plants, and can become sustained (and thus less flexible) at low temperatures. Long-lived, slow-growing plants with low intrinsic capacities for photosynthesis have greater capacities for this flexible dissipation than short-lived, fast-growing species. Furthermore, potent, but inflexible (zeaxanthin-facilitated) thermal dissipation, prominent in evergreen species under prolonged environmental stress, is characterized with respect to the involvement of photosystem {II} core rearrangement and/or degradation as well as the absence of control by trans-thylakoid {pH} and, possibly, {PsbS.} A role of {PsbS-related} proteins in photoprotection is discussed.},

	abstract = {Farmers and breeders have long known that often it is the simultaneous occurrence of several abiotic stresses, rather than a particular stress condition, that is most lethal to crops. Surprisingly, the co-occurrence of different stresses is rarely addressed by molecular biologists that study plant acclimation. Recent studies have revealed that the response of plants to a combination of two different abiotic stresses is unique and cannot be directly extrapolated from the response of plants to each of the different stresses applied individually. Tolerance to a combination of different stress conditions, particularly those that mimic the field environment, should be the focus of future research programs aimed at developing transgenic crops and plants with enhanced tolerance to naturally occurring environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Functions of α- and β-branch carotenoids in whole-plant acclimation to photo-oxidative stress were studied in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (wt) and carotenoid mutants, lutein deficient (lut2, lut5), non-photochemical quenching1 (npq1) and suppressor of zeaxanthin-less1 (szl1) npq1 double mutant. Photo-oxidative stress was applied by exposing plants to sunflecks. The sunflecks caused reduction of chlorophyll content in all plants, but more severely in those having high α- to β-branch carotenoid composition (α/β-ratio) (lut5, szl1npq1). While this did not alter carotenoid composition in wt or lut2, which accumulates only β-branch carotenoids, increased xanthophyll levels were found in the mutants with high α/β-ratios (lut5, szl1npq1) or without xanthophyll-cycle operation (npq1, szl1npq1). The {PsbS} protein content increased in all sunfleck plants but lut2. These changes were accompanied by no change (npq1, szl1npq1) or enhanced capacity (wt, lut5) of {NPQ.} Leaf mass per area increased in lut2, but decreased in wt and lut5 that showed increased {NPQ.} The sunflecks decelerated primary root growth in wt and npq1 having normal α/β-ratios, but suppressed lateral root formation in lut5 and szl1npq1 having high α/β-ratios. The results highlight the importance of proper regulation of the α- and β-branch carotenoid pathways for whole-plant acclimation, not only leaf photoprotection, under photo-oxidative stress.},

It then presents new physiological data from avocado on the time frames of the slow coordinated photosynthetic development of sink leaves in sunlight and on the slow renovation of photosynthetic properties in old leaves during sun to shade and shade to sun acclimation. In so doing, it grapples with issues in vivo that seem relevant to our increasingly sophisticated understanding of {ΔpH-dependent}, xanthophyll-pigment-stabilized non-photochemical quenching in the antenna of {PSII} in thylakoid membranes in vitro.},

	abstract = {Acclimation to fluctuating light environment with short (lasting 20 s, at 650 or 1,250 μmol photons m−2 s−1, every 6 or 12 min) or long (for 40 min at 650 μmol photons m−2 s−1, once a day at midday) sunflecks was studied in Arabidopsis thaliana. The sunfleck treatments were applied in the background daytime light intensity of 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1. In order to distinguish the effects of sunflecks from those of increased daily irradiance, constant light treatments at 85 and 120 μmol photons m−2 s−1, which gave the same photosynthetically active radiation ({PAR)} per day as the different sunfleck treatments, were also included in the experiments. The increased daily total {PAR} in the two higher constant light treatments enhanced photosystem {II} electron transport and starch accumulation in mature leaves and promoted expansion of young leaves in Columbia-0 plants during the 7-day treatments. Compared to the plants remaining under 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1, application of long sunflecks caused upregulation of electron transport without affecting carbon gain in the form of starch accumulation and leaf growth or the capacity of non-photochemical quenching ({NPQ).} Mature leaves showed marked enhancement of the {NPQ} capacity under the conditions with short sunflecks, which preceded recovery and upregulation of electron transport, demonstrating the initial priority of photoprotection. The distinct acclimatory responses to constant {PAR}, long sunflecks, and different combinations of short sunflecks are consistent with acclimatory adjustment of the processes in photoprotection and carbon gain, depending on the duration, frequency, and intensity of light fluctuations. While the responses of leaf expansion to short sunflecks differed among the seven Arabidopsis accessions examined, all plants showed {NPQ} upregulation, suggesting limited ability of this species to utilize short sunflecks. The increase in the {NPQ} capacity was accompanied by reduced chlorophyll contents, higher levels of the xanthophyll-cycle pigments, faster light-induced de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin, increased amounts of {PsbS} protein, as well as enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase. These acclimatory mechanisms, involving reorganization of pigment–protein complexes and upregulation of other photoprotective reactions, are probably essential for Arabidopsis plants to cope with photo-oxidative stress induced by short sunflecks without suffering from severe photoinhibition and lipid peroxidation.},

Microarray and northern-blot analyses were performed toward the identification of the factors and signaling pathways that enable plants to limit oxidative damage caused by exposure to high light ({HL).} Arabidopsis plants grown under moderate light (100 μmol m−2 s−1) were exposed to {HL} (1,000 μmol m−2 s−1) for 1 h. The microarray analyses revealed that exposure of Arabidopsis to {HL} caused an increase in known antioxidant genes, as well as several unknown genes. Some of these unknown genes had homologies to possible regulatory genes and metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, it was found that a range of chaperones were up-regulated in the {HL} treatment and that this induction was specifically due to the {HL} stress. The temporal expression under {HL} and different oxidative stress conditions of a subset of {HL-responsive} genes was confirmed via northern-blot analysis. Results from the arrays were also compared with publicly available microarray data sets from a range of different stress conditions at the Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Consortium. This cross comparison enabled the identification of genes that may be induced by changes in redox poise. Finally, to determine if the genes that were differentially expressed by {HL} stress were under similar transcriptional control, we analyzed the promoter sequences for the presence of common motifs.},

	abstract = {Motivation: A critical task in high-throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for {RNA} sequencing ({RNA-Seq)} because of {RNA} splicing. A number of {RNA-Seq} algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. {RNA-Seq} data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics {RNA-Seq} data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published {RNA-Seq} algorithms has not been performed previously.
Results: We developed an {RNA-Seq} simulator that models the main impediments to {RNA} alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction ({RT–PCR)} and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in {RNA-Seq} data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on {BLAT} was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the {RNA-Seq} Unified Mapper ({RUM)}, performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability.
Availability: The {RUM} pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine ({http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM).}

In this study, we sought to assess the contribution of the different analytical steps involved in the analysis of {RNA-seq} data generated with the Illumina platform, and to perform a cross-platform comparison based on the results obtained through Affymetrix microarray. As a case study for our work we, used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain {CEN.PK} 113-{7D}, grown under two different conditions (batch and chemostat). Here, we asses the influence of genetic variation on the estimation of gene expression level using three different aligners for read-mapping (Gsnap, Stampy and {TopHat)} on S288c genome, the capabilities of five different statistical methods to detect differential gene expression ({baySeq}, Cuffdiff, {DESeq}, {edgeR} and {NOISeq)} and we explored the consistency between {RNA-seq} analysis using reference genome and de novo assembly approach. High reproducibility among biological replicates (correlation ≥0.99) and high consistency between the two platforms for analysis of gene expression levels (correlation ≥0.91) are reported. The results from differential gene expression identification derived from the different statistical methods, as well as their integrated analysis results based on gene ontology annotation are in good agreement. Overall, our study provides a useful and comprehensive comparison between the two platforms ({RNA-seq} and microrrays) for gene expression analysis and addresses the contribution of the different steps involved in the analysis of {RNA-seq} data.},

	abstract = {Motivation: {RNA} sequencing is now widely performed to study differential expression among experimental conditions. As tests are performed on a large number of genes, very stringent false discovery rate control is required at the expense of detection power. Ad hoc filtering techniques are regularly used to moderate this correction by removing genes with low signal, with little attention paid to their impact on downstream analyses.
Results: We propose a data-driven method based on the Jaccard similarity index to calculate a filtering threshold for replicated {RNA-seq} data. In comparisons with alternative data filters regularly used in practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to correctly filter lowly expressed genes, leading to increased detection power for moderately to highly expressed genes. Interestingly, this data-driven threshold varies among experiments, highlighting the interest of the method proposed here.
Availability: The proposed filtering method is implemented in the R package {HTSFilter} available on Bioconductor.

In Arabidopsis grown with {NH\$} \_4{\textasciicircum}+ \$ as the sole N source, growth retardation occurs already at early stages before photosynthesis has come to its full power. In order to describe the peculiarities of these retarded plants, they were compared with nitrate ({NO\$} \_3{\textasciicircum}- \$)-grown plants of the same age of 15 d. Photosynthetic activity as measured by {CO2} uptake per unit chlorophyll is half as high in {NH\$} \_4{\textasciicircum}+ \$-grown seedlings as in {NO\$} \_3{\textasciicircum}- \$-grown ones. This finding is confirmed by the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence.

Gene-expression analysis based on {cDNA} microarray and on Northern blots provide a clue about the biochemical background. After the first 2 weeks of growth, it seems that {NO\$} \_3{\textasciicircum}- \$-grown seedlings subsist mainly on normal photosynthesis, whereas {NH\$} \_4{\textasciicircum}+ \$-grown seedlings still use lipids from the seeds stored in oleosomes.

Different carbohydrate sources for sucrose synthesis are indicated by different gene expression. Higher gene expression of fructose bisphosphate aldolase (cytosolic isoform) in {NO\$} \_3{\textasciicircum}- \$-grown seedlings indicates the dependence on photosynthesis, whereas a higher gene expression of {PEP} carboxykinase in {NH\$} \_4{\textasciicircum}+ \$-grown seedlings points to a prominent role of β-oxidation of storage lipids still present.},

Aside from reactive oxygen species ({ROS)} produced under stress conditions, changes in the reduction/oxidation state of photosynthetic electron transfer components or coupled compounds in the stroma and the accumulation of photosynthesis-derived metabolites are likely origins of chloroplast signals. We attempted to investigate the origin of the signals from chloroplasts in mature Arabidopsis leaves by differentially modulating the redox states of the plastoquinone pool and components on the reducing side of photosystem I, as well as the rate of {CO2} fixation, while avoiding the production of {ROS} by excess light. Differential expression of several nuclear photosynthesis genes, including a set of Calvin cycle enzymes, was recorded. These responded to the stromal redox conditions under prevailing light conditions but were independent of the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. The steady-state {CO2} fixation rate was reflected in the orchestration of the expression of a number of genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins, including several glycolysis genes and the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene, and also the chloroplast-targeted chaperone {DnaJ.} Clearly, in mature leaves, the redox state of the compounds on the reducing side of photosystem I is of greater importance in light-dependent modulation of nuclear gene expression than the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, particularly at early signaling phases. It also became apparent that photosynthesis-mediated generation of metabolites or signaling molecules is involved in the relay of information from chloroplast to nucleus.},

In the present studies, we showed for the first time that the plastoquinone-pool undergoes relatively fast oxidation during high light stress of low light-grown Arabidopsis plants. This oxidation was not caused by photoinhibition of photosystem {II}, but mainly by singlet oxygen generated in photosystem {II} and non-photochemical quenching in light harvesting complex antenna of the photosystem, as revealed in experiments with a singlet oxygen scavenger and with Arabidopsis npq4 mutant. The latter mechanism suppresses the influx of electrons to the plastoquinone-pool preventing its excessive reduction. The obtained results are of crucial importance in light of the function of the redox state of the plastoquinone-pool in triggering many high light-stimulated physiological responses of plants.},

	abstract = {Arabidopsis plants were exposed to high light or sulphur depletion alone or in combination for 6 d, and changes of photosynthetic parameters and metabolite abundances were quantified. Photosynthetic electron transport rates ({ETRs)} of plants exposed to sulphur depletion and high light decreased strongly at day 2 of the acclimation period. After 3 d of treatment, the photosynthetic capacity recovered in plants exposed to the combined stresses, indicating a short recovery time for re-adjustment of photosynthesis. However, at metabolic level, the stress combination had a profound effect on central metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid ({TCA)} cycle, glycolysis, pentose phosphate cycle and large parts of amino acid metabolism. Under these conditions, central metabolites, such as sugars and their phosphates, increased, while sulphur-containing compounds were decreased. Further differential responses were found for the stress indicator proline accumulating already at day 1 of the high-light regime, but in combination with sulphur depletion first declined and after a recovery phase reached a delayed elevated level. Other metabolites such as raffinose and putrescine seem to replace proline during the early combinatorial stress response and may act as alternative protectants. Our findings support the notion that plants integrate the selectively sensed stress factors in central metabolism.},

	abstract = {The capability of several polar macroalgal species to protect photosynthesis against excessive irradiation by dynamic photoinhibition was investigated and related to the specific depth distribution of the species. Photoinhibition of photosynthesis was induced by exposure of the algae to a photon fluence rate of 500 µmol m-2 s-1 for 2 h. Changes in the oxygen production rate and in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were recorded. For oxygen measurements gross Pmax and the slope (alpha) of the fluence rate-response curve were determined before and after photoinhibitory treatment and after recovery of photosynthesis in dim light. In fluorescence measurements the kinetics of change of the variable fluorescence during the inhibitory time phase and the recovery phase were determined. Significant differences in the reactions during exposure and recovery were found in the different algal classes. Within each class a correlation between species depth distribution and the ability to cope with high light stress was found. Algae growing in nature close to the water surface or in the intertidal were generally not severely stressed. Algae growing in the middle and upper subtidal zone showed a decrease in photosynthetic activity during high light stress with full recovery of photosynthesis in subsequent dim light. Fluorescence measurements showed that the reaction kinetics of photoinhibition and recovery were slower than in algae growing close to the water surface or in the intertidal. Algae growing in the lower subtidal also showed a decrease in the photosynthetic parameters due to high light stress; however, photosynthesis recovered only slightly and very slowly during subsequent dim light conditions. In these algae the decrease in the photosynthetic activity was caused by photodamage rather than by dynamic photoinhibition. In conclusion these experiments indicate that algae already cultured for a long time in the laboratory, retain a certain genetic adaptation to the natural light environment. This is true not only for the lower light limit, but also for the upper light limit.},

	abstract = {Intracellular proteases, together with molecular chaperones, are components of the cellular protein quality control system. Although the identity of chloroplast proteases has been revealed in recent years, little is known about their regulation. As a first step towards identifying unknown functional or regulatory components of the chloroplast proteolytic machinery, a genetic screen was devised with the aim of generating Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. mutants impaired in chloroplast protein degradation. A streptomycin-resistance gene was fused to a {cDNA} construct that encodes an unstable mutant of the {OE33} protein. This chimeric gene was used for transforming Arabidopsis plants. Analysis of transgenic plants revealed a correlation between streptomycin resistance and accumulation of the recombinant fusion protein. Seeds from transgenic plants that were sensitive to streptomycin were chemically mutagenized and screened for resistance to streptomycin. Such resistance could be due to stabilization of the protein caused by a mutation in the chloroplast proteolytic machinery. Genetic analysis of one of the mutants showed the mutation to be recessive, in a single nuclear gene. Further characterization of the mutant revealed that it was not a result of increased transcription of the transgene. Moreover, chloroplast lysates from the mutant plant showed decreased {ATP-dependent} degradation of a chloroplast protein substrate, consistent with the conclusion that the mutation impaired the proteolytic machinery. Physiological analysis revealed that upon cold stress, photoprotection and photosynthesis in the mutant was inhibited, suggesting that the chloroplast proteolytic machinery is involved in repairing damage incurred to the photosynthetic machinery upon exposure to cold temperatures.},

Plants can respond defensively to this stress for a limited period and this involves changes to their gene expression profiles. Proteomic approaches were therefore applied to the study of the response to high light stress in the Arabidopsis thaliana plant species. Wild-type Arabidopsis was grown under normal light (100 μmol photons·m−2·s−1) conditions and then subjected to high light (1000 μmol photons·m−2·s−1) stress. Chloroplasts were then isolated from these plants and both soluble and insoluble proteins were extracted and subjected to two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were subsequently identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry ({MALDI-TOF-MS)} and comparative database analysis. 64 protein spots, which were identified as candidate factors that responded to high light stress, were then selected for analysis and 52 of these were successfully identified using {MALDI-TOF-MS} analysis. 35 of the 52 identified proteins were found to decrease their expression levels during high light stress and a further 14 of the candidate proteins had upregulated expression levels under these conditions. Most of the proteins that were downregulated during high light stress are involved in photosynthesis pathways. However, many of the 14 upregulated proteins were identified as previously well-known high light stress-related proteins, such as heat shock proteins ({HSPs)}, dehydroascorbate reductase ({DHAR)}, and superoxide dismutase ({SOD).} Three novel proteins that were more highly expressed during periods of high light stress but had no clear functional relationship to these conditions, were also identified in this study.},

	abstract = {When grown in short day conditions and at low light, leaves of Arabidopsis plants with mutations in the genes encoding two plastidial {ATP/ADP} transporters (so-called null mutants) spontaneously develop necrotic lesions. Under these conditions, the mutants also display light-induced accumulation of {H2O2} and constitutive expression of genes for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 2 and ascorbate peroxidase 1. In the light phase, null mutants accumulate high levels of phototoxic protoporphyrin {IX} but have only slightly reduced levels of Mg protoporphyrin {IX.} The physiological changes are associated with reduced magnesium–chelatase activity. Since the expression of genes encoding any of the three subunits of magnesium–chelatase is similar in wild type and null mutants, decreased enzyme activity is probably due to post-translational modification which might be due to limited availability of {ATP} in plastids during the night. Surprisingly, the formation of necrotic lesions was absent when null mutants were grown either in long days and low light intensity or in short days and high light intensity. We ascribe the lack of lesion phenotype to increased nocturnal {ATP} supply due to glycolytic degradation of starch which may lead to additional substrate-level phosphorylation in the stroma. Thus, nocturnal import of {ATP} into chloroplasts represents a crucial, previously unknown process that is required for controlled chlorophyll biosynthesis and for preventing photooxidative damage.},

At least two different pathways are thought to participate in this process, i.e. cyclic electron flow and the water-water cycle. Although the function of the water-water cycle was inferred from a number of biochemical and physiological studies, genetic evidence for the function of this cycle is very limited. Here we show that knockdown Arabidopsis plants with suppressed expression of the key water-water cycle enzyme, thylakoid-attached copper/zinc superoxide dismutase ({KD-SOD)}, are suppressed in their growth and development. Chloroplast size, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic activity were also reduced in {KD-SOD} plants. Microarray analysis of {KD-SOD} plants, grown under controlled conditions, revealed changes in transcript expression consistent with an acclimation response to light stress. Although a number of transcripts involved in the defense of plants from oxidative stress were induced in {KD-SOD} plants, and seedlings of {KD-SOD} plants were more tolerant to oxidative stress, these mechanisms were unable to compensate for the suppression of the water-water cycle in mature leaves. Thus, the localization of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase at the vicinity of photosystem I may be essential for its function. Our studies provide genetic evidence for the importance of the water-water cycle in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants from photooxidative damage.},

Comparison of temperature and developmental responses in seven accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana from northern habitats showed that the regulation is widely genetically manifested, but hardly correlates with geographic parameters. Transcript, polysomal {RNA} ({pRNA)} and protein data showed that the ecotypes use different strategies to adjust the chloroplast antioxidative defense system, either by regulating transcript abundance or initiation of translation. Comparison of {mRNA} and {pRNA} levels showed that Col-0 invests more into transcript accumulation, while Van-0, {WS} and C24 regulates the chloroplast antioxidant protection system more on the level of {pRNA.} Nevertheless, both strategies of regulation led to the expression of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes at sufficient level to efficiently protect plants from {ROS} accumulation in Col-0, {WS}, C24 and Van-0. On the contrary, Cvi-0, Ms-0 and Kas-1 accumulated high amounts of {ROS.} The expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Csd2), ascorbate peroxidases and 2-Cys peroxiredoxins was higher in Cvi-0 on the transcriptional level, while Csd2, peroxiredoxin Q, type {II} peroxiredoxin E and glutathione peroxidase 1 were induced in Ms-0 on the {mRNA} level. Similar to Kas-1, in which {mRNA} levels were less than or similar to Col-0 gene, specific support for translation was observed in Ms-0, showing that the ecotypes use different strategies to adjust the antioxidant system.},

	abstract = {An Arabidopsis thaliana drought-tolerant mutant, altered expression of {APX2} (alx8), has constitutively increased abscisic acid ({ABA)} content, increased expression of genes responsive to high light stress and is reported to be drought tolerant. We have identified alx8 as a mutation in {SAL1}, an enzyme that can dephosphorylate dinucleotide phosphates or inositol phosphates. Previously identified mutations in {SAL1}, including fiery (fry1-1), were reported as being more sensitive to drought imposed by detachment of rosettes. Here we demonstrate that alx8, fry1-1 and a T-{DNA} insertional knockout allele all have markedly increased resistance to drought when water is withheld from soil-grown intact plants. Microarray analysis revealed constitutively altered expression of more than 1800 genes in both alx8 and fry1-1. The up-regulated genes included some characterized stress response genes, but few are inducible by {ABA.} Metabolomic analysis revealed that both mutants exhibit a similar, dramatic reprogramming of metabolism, including increased levels of the polyamine putrescine implicated in stress tolerance, and the accumulation of a number of unknown, potential osmoprotectant carbohydrate derivatives. Under well-watered conditions, there was no substantial difference between alx8 and Col-0 in biomass at maturity; plant water use efficiency ({WUE)} as measured by carbon isotope discrimination; or stomatal index, morphology or aperture. Thus, {SAL1} acts as a negative regulator of predominantly {ABA-independent} and also {ABA-dependent} stress response pathways, such that its inactivation results in altered osmoprotectants, higher leaf relative water content and maintenance of viable tissues during prolonged water stress.},

The lack of the {STN7} kinase and state transitions in stn7 also modified the thylakoid protein contents upon long-term low light acclimation resulting, for example, in low Lhcb1 and in elevated Lhca1 and Lhca2 protein amounts as compared to {WT.} Adjustments of thylakoid protein contents probably occurred at post-transcriptional level since the {DNA} microarray experiments from each growth condition did not reveal any significant differences between stn7 and {WT} transcriptomes. The resulting high {Lhcb2/Lhcb1} ratio in stn7 upon growth at low light was accompanied by lower capacity for {NPQ} than in {WT.} On the contrary, higher amounts of {PsbS} in stn7 under moderate and high light growth conditions resulted in higher {NPQ} compared to {WT} and consequently also in a protection of {PSII} against photoinhibition. {STN7} kinase and the state transitions are suggested to have a physiological significance for dynamic acclimation to low but fluctuating growth light conditions. They are shown to function as a buffering system upon short high light illumination peaks by shifting the thylakoids from state 2 to state 1 and thereby down regulating the induction of stress-responsive genes, a likely result from transient over-reduction of {PSI} acceptors.},

	abstract = {Photoinactivation of photosystem {II} ({PSII)}, the light-induced loss of ability to evolve oxygen, is an inevitable event during normal photosynthesis, exacerbated by saturating light but counteracted by repair via new protein synthesis. The photoinactivation of {PSII} is dependent on the dosage of light: in the absence of repair, typically one {PSII} is photoinactivated per 10(7) photons, although the exact quantum yield of photoinactivation is modulated by a number of factors, and decreases as fewer active {PSII} targets are available. {PSII} complexes initially appear to be photoinactivated independently; however, when less than 30\% functional {PSII} complexes remain, they seem to be protected by strongly dissipative {PSII} reaction centres in several plant species examined so far, a mechanism which we term 'inactive {PSII-mediated} quenching'. This mechanism appears to require a {pH} gradient across the photosynthetic membrane for its optimal operation. The residual fraction of functional {PSII} complexes may, in turn, aid in the recovery of photoinactivated {PSII} complexes when conditions become less severe. This mechanism may be important for the photosynthetic apparatus in extreme environments such as those experienced by over-wintering evergreen plants, desert plants exposed to drought and full sunlight and shade plants in sustained sunlight.},

	abstract = {Photoinhibition is an inevitable consequence of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, the concept of a ‘photoinhibition-proof’ plant in which photosystem {II} ({PSII)} is immune to photodamage is useful as a benchmark for considering the performances of plants with varying mixes of mechanisms which limit the extent of photodamage and which repair photodamage. Some photodamage is bound to occur, and the energy costs of repair are the direct costs of repair plus the photosynthesis foregone during repair. One mechanism permitting partial avoidance of photodamage is restriction of the number of photons incident on the photosynthetic apparatus per unit time, achieved by phototactic movement of motile algae to places with lower incident photosynthetically active radiation ({PAR)}, by phototactic movement of plastids within cells to positions that minimize the incident {PAR} and by photonastic relative movements of parts of photolithotrophs attached to a substrate. The other means of avoiding photodamage is dissipating excitation of photosynthetic pigments including state transitions, non-photochemical quenching by one of the xanthophyll cycles or some other process and photochemical quenching by increased electron flow through {PSII} involving {CO2} and other acceptors, including the engagement of additional electron transport pathways. These mechanisms inevitably have the potential to decrease the rate of growth. As well as the decreased photosynthetic rates as a result of photodamage and the restrictions on photosynthesis imposed by the repair, avoidance, quenching and scavenging mechanisms, there are also additional energy, nitrogen and phosphorus costs of producing and operating repair, avoidance, quenching and scavenging mechanisms. A comparison is also made between the costs of photoinhibition and those of other plant functions impeded by the occurrence of oxygenic photosynthesis, i.e. the competitive inhibition of the carboxylase activity of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase by oxygen via the oxygenase activity, and oxygen damage to nitrogenase in diazotrophic organisms.},

Paradoxically, sunlight damages the photosynthetic machinery, primarily photosystem {II} ({PSII)}, leading to photoinhibition and loss of plant performance. However, there is uncertainty about which wavelengths are most damaging to {PSII} under sunlight. In this work we examined this in a simple experiment where Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves were exposed to different wavelengths of sunlight by dispersing the solar radiation across the surface of the leaf via a prism. To isolate only the process of photodamage, the repair of photodamaged {PSII} was inhibited by infiltration of chloramphenicol into the exposed leaves. The extent of photodamage was then measured as the decrease in the maximum quantum yield of {PSII} using an imaging pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer. Under the experimental light conditions, photodamage to {PSII} occurred most strongly in regions exposed to ultraviolet ({UV)} or yellow light. The extent of {UV} photodamage under incident sunlight would be greater than we observed when one corrects for the optical efficiency of our system. Our results suggest that photodamage to {PSII} under sunlight is primarily associated with {UV} rather than photosynthetically active light wavelengths.},

In particular, production of D1 protein is downregulated at the translation step by the direct inactivation of the translation machinery and/or by primarily interrupting the fixation of {CO2.} The latter results in the creation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS)}, which in turn block the synthesis of {PSII} proteins in chloroplasts.},

The extent of photoinhibition is associated with a balance between the rate of photodamage and its repair. Recent studies have shown that light absorption by the manganese cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex of {PSII} causes primary photodamage, whereas excess light absorbed by light-harvesting complexes acts to cause inhibition of the {PSII} repair process chiefly through the generation of reactive oxygen species. As we review here, {PSII} photodamage and the inhibition of repair are therefore alleviated by photoprotection mechanisms associated with avoiding light absorption by the manganese cluster and successfully consuming or dissipating the light energy absorbed by photosynthetic pigments, respectively.},

Long Hypocotyl in Far-Red 1 ({HFR1)} has been identified as a positive regulator and a possible transcription factor in both blue and far-red light signaling in plants. However, the gene targets that are regulated by {HFR1} in cryptochrome 1 (cry1)-mediated blue light signaling have not been globally addressed. We examined the transcriptome profiles in a cry1- and {HFR1-dependent} manner in response to 1 hour of blue light. Strikingly, more than 70\% of the genes induced by blue light in an {HFR1-dependent} manner were dependent on cry1, and vice versa. High overrepresentation of W-boxes and {OCS} elements were found in these genes, indicating that this strong cry1 and {HFR1} co-regulation on gene expression is possibly through these two cis-elements. We also found that cry1 was required for maintaining the {HFR1} protein level in blue light, and that the {HFR1} protein level is strongly correlated with the global gene expression pattern. In summary, {HFR1}, which is fine-tuned by cry1, is crucial for regulating global gene expression in cry1-mediated early blue light signaling, especially for the function of genes containing W-boxes and {OCS} elements.},

	abstract = {Blue light modulates many processes in plants and plant cells. It influences global and long-term responses, such as seedling development and phototropism, and induces short-term adaptations like stomatal opening and chloroplast movement. Three genes were identified as important for the latter process, namely {PHOT1}, {PHOT2} and {CHUP1.} The former two phototropin blue light receptors act in perception of the blue light signal. The protein {CHUP1} is localised to the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts and is involved in chloroplast movement. To explore whether short-term reactions required for chloroplast movement are under transcriptional control, we analysed the transcriptome in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana, phot1, phot2 and chup1 with different blue light treatments for 5 or 30 min. Blue light-induced changes in transcription depended on illumination time and intensity. Illumination with 100 μmol·m−2·s−1 blue light induced down-regulation of several genes and might point to cascades that could be important for sensing low levels of blue light. Analysis of the transcriptome of the mutants in response to the different light regimes suggests that the transcriptional response to blue light in the wild-type can be attributed to phot1 rather than phot2, suggesting that blue light-induced alteration of expression is a function of phot1. In contrast, the blue light response at the transcriptional level of chup1 plants was unique, and confirmed the higher light sensitivity of this mutant.},

	abstract = {In plants, low temperature causes massive transcriptional changes, many of which are presumed to be involved in the process of cold acclimation. Given the diversity of developmental and environmental factors between experiments, it is surprising that their influence on the identification of cold-responsive genes is largely unknown. A systematic investigation of genes responding to 1 d of cold treatment revealed that diurnal- and circadian-regulated genes are responsible for the majority of the substantial variation between experiments. This is contrary to the widespread assumption that these effects are eliminated using paired diurnal controls. To identify the molecular basis for this variation, we performed targeted expression analyses of diurnal and circadian time courses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that, after a short initial cold response, in diurnal conditions cold reduces the amplitude of cycles for clock components and dampens or disrupts the cycles of output genes, while in continuous light all cycles become arrhythmic. This means that genes identified as cold-responsive are dependent on the time of day the experiment was performed and that a control at normal temperature will not correct for this effect, as was postulated up to now. Time of day also affects the number and strength of expression changes for a large number of transcription factors, and this likely further contributes to experimental differences. This reveals that interactions between cold and diurnal regulation are major factors in shaping the cold-responsive transcriptome and thus will be an important consideration in future experiments to dissect transcriptional regulatory networks controlling cold acclimation. In addition, our data revealed differential effects of cold on circadian output genes and a unique regulation of an oscillator component, suggesting that cold treatment could also be an important tool to probe circadian and diurnal regulatory mechanisms.},

The illumination at all light intensities caused photoinhibition, measured as a decrease in the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence. Loss of photosystem {II} ({PSII)} electron transfer activity correlated with the decrease in the fluorescence ratio. The rate constant of photoinhibition, determined from first-order fits, was directly proportional to photon flux density at all light intensities studied. The fluorescence ratio did not decrease if the leaves were illuminated in low light in the absence of lincomycin or incubated in darkness in the presence of lincomycin. The constancy of the quantum yield of photoinhibition under different photon flux densities strongly suggests that photoinhibition in vivo occurs by one dominant mechanism under all light intensities. This mechanism probably is not the acceptor side mechanism characterized in the anaerobic case in vitro. Furthermore, there was an excellent correlation between the loss of {PSII} activity and the loss of the D1 protein from thylakoid membranes under low light. At low light, photoinhibition occurs so slowly that inactive {PSII} centers with the D1 protein waiting to be degraded do not accumulate. The kinetic agreement between D1 protein degradation and the inactivation of {PSII} indicates that the turnover of the D1 protein depends on photoinhibition under both low and high light.},

Thus, protective integrated regulatory responses that can dissipate excess of absorbed light energy and simultaneously optimize photosynthesis and other cellular processes under variable light conditions can prove highly adaptive. Here, we show that the local and systemic responses to an excess light episode are associated with photoelectrophysiological signaling ({PEPS)} as well as with changes in nonphotochemical quenching and reactive oxygen species levels. During an excess light incident, {PEPS} is induced by quantum redox changes in photosystem {II} and in its proximity and/or by changes in glutathione metabolism in chloroplasts. {PEPS} is transduced, at least in part, by bundle sheath cells and is light wavelength specific. {PEPS} systemic propagation speed and action potential are dependent on {ASCORBATE} {PEROXIDASE2} function. Excess light episodes are physiologically memorized in leaves, and the cellular light memory effect is specific for an excess of blue (450 nm) and red (650 nm) light of similar energy. It is concluded that plants possess a complex and dynamic light training and memory system that involves quantum redox, reactive oxygen species, hormonal, and {PEPS} signaling and is used to optimize light acclimation and immune defenses.},

We investigated the role of an Arabidopsis thaliana zinc finger transcription factor, {ZAT10}, in {SAA.} {ZAT10} overexpression resulted in enhanced tolerance to photoinhibitory light and exogenous {H2O2}, increased expression of antioxidative genes whose products are targeted to multiple subcellular compartments. Partial {HL} exposure of a leaf or leaves rapidly induced {ZAT10} {mRNA} in distal, shaded photosynthetic tissues, including the floral stem, cauline leaves, and rosette, but not in roots. Fully 86\% of fivefold {HL-upregulated} and 71\% of {HL-downregulated} genes were induced and repressed, respectively, in distal, shaded leaves. Between 15 and 23\% of genes whose expression changed in the {HL} and/or distal tissues were coexpressed in the {ZAT10} overexpression plants, implicating {ZAT10} in modulating the expression of {SAA-regulated} genes. The {SAA} response was detectable in plants with mutations in abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, or salicylic acid synthesis or perception, and systemic {H2O2} diffusion was not detected. Hence, {SAA} is distinct from pathogen-stimulated systemic acquired resistance and apparently involves a novel signal or combination of signals that preacclimate photosynthetic tissues to {HL.}},

Plant survival is crucially dependent on an efficient molecular repair of damaged {PSII} realized by a multistep repair cycle. The {PSII} repair cycle requires a brisk lateral protein traffic between stacked grana thylakoids and unstacked stroma lamellae that is challenged by the tight stacking and low protein mobility in grana. We demonstrated that high light stress induced two main structural changes that work synergistically to improve the accessibility between damaged {PSII} in grana and its repair machinery in stroma lamellae: lateral shrinkage of grana diameter and increased protein mobility in grana thylakoids. It follows that high light stress triggers an architectural switch of the thylakoid network that is advantageous for swift protein repair. Studies of the thylakoid kinase mutant stn8 and the double mutant stn7/8 demonstrate the central role of protein phosphorylation for the structural alterations. These findings are based on the elaboration of mathematical tools for analyzing confocal laser-scanning microscopic images to study changes in the sophisticated thylakoid architecture in intact protoplasts.},

The damage is caused in part by reactive oxygen species ({ROS)} generated by electrons leaking from the photosynthetic electron transport system. To investigate the mechanisms equipped in higher plants to reduce high light ({HL)} stress, we surveyed the response of 7000 Arabidopsis genes to {HL}, taking advantage of the recently developed microarray technology. Our analysis revealed that 110 genes had a positive response to a 3 h treatment at a light intensity of 150 W m−2. In addition to the scavenging enzymes of {ROS}, the genes involved in biosynthesis of lignins and flavonoids are activated by {HL} and actually resulted in increased accumulation of lignins and anthocyanins. Comparing the {HL-responsive} genes with drought-inducible genes identified with the same microarray system revealed a dense overlap between {HL-} and drought-inducible genes. In addition, we have identified 10 genes that showed upregulation by {HL}, drought, cold and also salt stress. These genes include {RD29A}, {ERD7}, {ERD10}, {KIN1}, {LEA14} and {COR15a}, most of which are thought to be involved in the protection of cellular components.},

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which changes in irradiance are sensed and how the information is transduced to the nucleus to initiate the genetic response. To investigate whether the photoreceptors are involved in the response to high irradiance, we analyzed expression of {EARLY} {LIGHT-INDUCIBLE} {PROTEIN1} ({ELIP1)}, {ELIP2}, {ASCORBATE} {PEROXIDASE2} ({APX2)}, and {LIGHT-HARVESTING} {CHLOROPHYLL} {A/B-BINDING} {PROTEIN2.4} ({LHCB2.4)} in the phytochrome A ({phyA)}, {phyB}, cryptochrome1 (cry1), and cry2 photoreceptor mutants and long hypocotyl5 (hy5) and {HY5} homolog (hyh) transcription factor mutants. Following exposure to high intensity white light for 3 h (1,000 μmol quanta m−2 s−1) expression of {ELIP1/2} and {APX2} was strongly induced and {LHCB2.4} expression repressed in wild type. The cry1 and hy5 mutants showed specific misregulation of {ELIP1/2}, and we show that the induction of {ELIP1/2} expression is mediated via {CRY1} in a blue light intensity-dependent manner. Furthermore, using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 24 K Gene-Chip, we showed that 77 of the high light-responsive genes are regulated via {CRY1}, and 26 of those genes were also {HY5} dependent. As a consequence of the misregulation of these genes, the cry1 mutant displayed a high irradiance-sensitive phenotype with significant photoinactivation of photosystem {II}, indicated by reduced maximal fluorescence ratio. Thus, we describe a novel function of {CRY1} in mediating plant responses to high irradiances that is essential to the induction of photoprotective mechanisms. This indicates that high irradiance can be sensed in a chloroplast-independent manner by a cytosolic/nucleic component.},

	abstract = {Cyclic electron flow ({CEF)} around photosystem I has a role in avoiding photoinhibition of photosystem {II} ({PSII)}, which occurs under conditions in which the rate of photodamage to {PSII} exceeds the rate of its repair. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how {CEF} contributes to photoprotection is not yet well understood. We examined the effect of impairment of {CEF} and thermal energy dissipation ({qE)} on photoinhibition using {CEF} (pgr5) and {qE} (npq1 and npq4) mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) exposed to strong light. Impairment of {CEF} by mutation of pgr5 suppressed {qE} and accelerated photoinhibition. We found that impairment of {qE}, by mutations of pgr5, npq1, and npq4, caused inhibition of the repair of photodamaged {PSII} at the step of the de novo synthesis of the D1 protein. In the presence of the chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol, impairment of {CEF}, but not impairment of {qE}, accelerated photoinhibition, and a similar effect was obtained when leaves were infiltrated with the protonophore nigericin. These results suggest that {CEF-dependent} generation of {ΔpH} across the thylakoid membrane helps to alleviate photoinhibition by at least two different photoprotection mechanisms: one is linked to {qE} generation and prevents the inhibition of the repair of photodamaged {PSII} at the step of protein synthesis, and the other is independent of {qE} and suppresses photodamage to {PSII.}},

This study examines the metabolic changes during photoacclimation to high-light ({HL)} stress in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. Using principal component analysis, a clear metabolic response to {HL} intensity was observed on global metabolite pools, with major changes in the levels of amino acids and related nitrogen metabolites. Amino acid pools increased during short-term photoacclimation, but were especially prominent in {HL-acclimated} cultures. Unexpectedly, we observed an increase in mitochondrial metabolism through downstream photorespiratory pathways. The expression of two genes encoding key enzymes in the photorespiratory pathway, glycolate dehydrogenase and malate synthase, were highly responsive to the {HL} stress. We propose that this pathway contributes to metabolite pools involved in nitrogen assimilation and may play a direct role in photoacclimation. Our results suggest that primary and secondary metabolism is highly pliable and plays a critical role in coping with the energetic imbalance during {HL} exposure and a necessary adjustment to support an increased growth rate that is an effective energy sink for the excess reducing power generated during {HL} stress.},

	abstract = {Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) immutans (im) has green and white sectoring due to the action of a nuclear recessive gene, {IMMUTANS.} The green sectors contain normal-appearing chloroplasts, whereas the white sectors contain abnormal chloroplasts that lack colored carotenoids due to a defect in phytoene desaturase activity. Previous biochemical and molecular characterizations of the green leaf sectors revealed alterations suggestive of a source-sink relationship between the green and white sectors of im. In this study, we use an Affymetrix {ATH1} oligoarray to further explore the nature of sink metabolism in im white tissues. We show that lack of colored carotenoids in the im white tissues elicits a differential response from a large number of genes involved in various cellular processes and stress responses. Gene expression patterns correlate with the repression of photosynthesis and photosynthesis-related processes in im white tissues, with an induction of Suc catabolism and transport, and with mitochondrial electron transport and fermentation. These results suggest that energy is derived via aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of imported sugar in im white tissues for growth and development. We also show that oxidative stress responses are largely induced in im white tissues; however, im green sectors develop additional energy-dissipating mechanisms that perhaps allow for the formation of green sectors. Furthermore, a comparison of the transcriptomes of im white and norflurazon-treated white leaf tissues reveals global as well as tissue-specific responses to photooxidation. We conclude that the differences in the mechanism of phytoene desaturase inhibition play an important role in differentiating these two white tissues.},

Flavonoids and related metabolites were identified and profiled by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry ({LC–MS/MS).} The ascorbate-deficient mutants vtc1, vtc2 and vtc3 accumulated less anthocyanin than wild-type ({WT)} during {HL} acclimation. In contrast, kaempferol glycoside accumulation was less affected by light and not decreased by ascorbate deficiency, while sinapoyl malate levels decreased during {HL} acclimation. Comparison of six Arabidopsis ecotypes showed a positive correlation between ascorbate and anthocyanin accumulation in {HL.} {mRNA-Seq} analysis showed that all flavonoid biosynthesis transcripts were increased by {HL} acclimation in {WT.} {RT-PCR} analysis showed that vtc1 and vtc2 were impaired in {HL} induction of transcripts of anthocyanin biosynthesis enzymes, and the transcription factors {PAP1}, {GL3} and {EGL3} that activate the pathway. Abscisic acid ({ABA)} and jasmonic acid ({JA)}, hormones that could affect anthocyanin accumulation, were unaffected in vtc mutants. It is concluded that {HL} induction of anthocyanin synthesis involves a redox-sensitive process upstream of the known transcription factors. Because anthocyanins accumulate in preference to kaempferol glycosides and sinapoyl malate in {HL}, they might have specific properties that make them useful in {HL} acclimation.},

Heat stress in nature is frequently accompanied by high light, and photoinhibition is a major limitation for photosynthesis. Light induction of {HSPs} may help ameliorate damage from excess light. In this study, we asked if accumulation of representative {HSPs} differed in naturally occurring Solidago altissima (goldenrod) in contrasting light microclimates (open sun vs. shade) and on cool vs. warm days. Our results show that {HSP} content in field-grown plants, undergoing natural temperature stress, was greater in open sun than shaded environments. Supporting these results, both light and temperature significantly affected accumulation of {HSPs} in the laboratory. This is the first study to show that the interaction of light microclimate and temperature can significantly influence {HSP} accumulation in field-grown plants.},

	abstract = {Coral bleaching, caused by heat stress, is accompanied by the light-induced loss of photosynthetic pigments in in situ symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium spp.). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for pigment loss are poorly understood. Here, we show that moderate heat stress causes photobleaching through inhibition of the de novo synthesis of intrinsic light-harvesting antennae [chlorophyll a–chlorophyll c 2–peridinin–protein complexes ({acpPC)]} in cultured Symbiodinium algae and that two Clade A Symbiodinium species showing different thermal sensitivities of photobleaching also show differential sensitivity of this key protein synthesis process. Photoinhibition of photosystem {II} ({PSII)} and subsequent photobleaching were observed at temperatures of {\textgreater}{31°C} in cultured Symbiodinium {CS-73} cells grown at {25–34°C}, but not in cultures of the more thermally tolerant control Symbiodinium species {OTcH-1.} We found that bleaching in {CS-73} is associated with loss of {acpPC}, which is a major antennae protein in Symbiodinium. In addition, the thermally induced loss of this protein is light-dependent, but does not coincide directly with {PSII} photoinhibition and is not caused by stimulated degradation of {acpPC.} In cells treated at {34°C} over 24 h, the steady-state {acpPC} {mRNA} pool was modestly reduced, by ≈30\%, whereas the corresponding synthesis rate of {acpPC} was diminished by {\textgreater}80\%. Our results suggest that photobleaching in Symbiodinium is consequentially linked to the relative susceptibility of {PSII} to photoinhibition during thermal stress and occurs, at least partially, because of the loss of {acpPC} via undefined mechanism(s) that hamper the de novo synthesis of {acpPC} primarily at the translational processing step.},

Under these conditions, {ROS} and redox cues, generated in the chloroplast and mitochondria, are essential for maintaining normal energy and metabolic fluxes, optimizing different cell functions, activating acclimation responses through retrograde signalling, and controlling whole-plant systemic signalling pathways.

Thus, analysis solely of plants grown under constant conditions may give partial or misleading indications of their responses to the fluctuating natural conditions in which they evolved. To obtain data on growth condition-dependent differences in metabolite levels, we compared leaf metabolite profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana growing under three constant laboratory light conditions: 30 [low light ({LL)]}, 300 [normal light ({NL)]} and 600 [high light ({HL)]µmol} photons m−2 s−1. We also shifted plants to the field and followed their metabolite composition for 3 d. Numerous compounds showed light intensity-dependent accumulation, including: many sugars and sugar derivatives (fructose, sucrose, glucose, galactose and raffinose); tricarboxylic acid ({TCA)} cycle intermediates; and amino acids (ca. 30\% of which were more abundant under {HL} and 60\% under {LL).} However, the patterns differed after shifting {NL} plants to field conditions. Levels of most identified metabolites (mainly amino acids, sugars and {TCA} cycle intermediates) rose after 2 h and peaked after 73 h, indicative of a ‘biphasic response’ and ‘circadian’ effects. The results provide new insight into metabolomic level mechanisms of plant acclimation, and highlight the role of known protectants under natural conditions.},

To gain a deeper insight into this control mechanism in Synechocystis sp. strain {PCC} 6803, we studied the expression and regulation of the {psaAB} operon, encoding the reaction center proteins of {PSI}, during the initial stage of acclimation to changes in the intensity and quality of light. The {psaAB} operon was transcribed as a dicistronic transcript, which was processed into smaller, putatively monocistronic {psaA} and {psaB} transcript species. Dark treatment of the cells inhibited the {psaAB} transcription, whereas re-illumination of dark-adapted cells reactivated the transcription slowly in a process requiring de novo protein synthesis. Transfer of cells from white to orange light, favoring excitation of {PSII}, stimulated the {psaAB} transcription, whereas far-red light, primarily exciting {PSI}, down-regulated the transcription of the {psaAB} operon. These results, together with down-regulation of {psaAB} transcription upon the addition of electron transport inhibitors under constant white light illumination, suggested that the photosynthetic redox poise affects the {psaAB} transcription activity in the light. Pulse-labeling experiments demonstrated that light-induced modulations in the translation rate of the {PsaA} protein closely parallel the transcription rate of the {psaAB} operon, indicating that transcriptional regulation plays the major role in determining the content of {PSI} reaction center proteins and, thereby, {PSI} complexes, during light acclimation. The scantiness of {PsaA} translation in darkness despite the abundance of {psaA} transcripts demonstrated that the comprehensive regulation of {PSI} accumulation also involves regulation at the level of translation.},

	abstract = {In dense plant populations, individuals shade each other resulting in a low-light habitat that is enriched in far-red light. This light quality gradient decreases the efficiency of the photosynthetic light reaction as a result of imbalanced excitation of the two photosystems. Plants counteract such conditions by performing acclimation reactions. Two major mechanisms are known to assure efficient photosynthesis: state transitions, which act on a short-term timescale; and a long-term response, which enables the plant to re-adjust photosystem stoichiometry in favour of the rate-limiting photosystem. Both processes start with the perception of the imbalanced photosystem excitation via reduction/oxidation (redox) signals from the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Recent data in Arabidopsis indicate that initialization of the molecular processes in both cases involve the activity of the thylakoid membrane-associated kinase, {STN7.} Thus, redox-controlled phosphorylation events may not only adjust photosystem antenna structure but may also affect plastid, as well as nuclear, gene expression. Both state transitions and the long-term response have been described mainly in molecular terms, while the physiological relevance concerning plant survival and reproduction has been poorly investigated. Recent studies have shed more light on this topic. Here, we give an overview on the long-term response, its physiological effects, possible mechanisms and its relationship to state transitions as well as to nonphotochemical quenching, another important short-term mechanism that mediates high-light acclimation. Special emphasis is given to the functional roles and potential interactions between the different light acclimation strategies. A working model displays the various responses as an integrated molecular system that helps plants to acclimate to the changing light environment.},

	abstract = {The term ‘photosynthetic control’ describes the short- and long-term mechanisms that regulate reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport ({PET)} chain so that the rate of production of {ATP} and {NADPH} is coordinated with the rate of their utilization in metabolism. At low irradiances these mechanisms serve to optimize light use efficiency, while at high irradiances they operate to dissipate excess excitation energy as heat. Similarly, the production of {ATP} and {NADPH} in ratios tailored to meet demand is finely tuned by a sophisticated series of controls that prevents the accumulation of high {NAD(P)H/NAD(P)} ratios and {ATP/ADP} ratios that would lead to potentially harmful over-reduction and inactivation of {PET} chain components. In recent years, photosynthetic control has also been extrapolated to the regulation of gene expression because mechanisms that are identical or similar to those that serve to regulate electron flow through the {PET} chain also coordinate the regulated expression of genes encoding photosynthetic proteins. This requires coordinated gene expression in the chloroplasts, mitochondria, and nuclei, involving complex networks of forward and retrograde signalling pathways. Photosynthetic control operates to control photosynthetic gene expression in response to environmental and metabolic changes. Mining literature data on transcriptome profiles of C3 and C4 leaves from plants grown under high atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO2)} levels compared with those grown with ambient {CO2} reveals that the transition to higher photorespiratory conditions in C3 plants enhances the expression of genes associated with cyclic electron flow pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana, consistent with the higher {ATP} requirement (relative to {NADPH)} of photorespiration.},

	abstract = {Kelps, brown algae of the order Laminariales, dominate rocky shores and form huge kelp beds which provide habitat and nurseries for various marine organisms. Whereas the basic physiological and ecophysiological characteristics of kelps are well studied, the molecular processes underlying acclimation to different light and temperature conditions are still poorly understood. Therefore we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological acclimation to light and temperature stress. Sporophytes of S. latissima were exposed to combinations of light intensities and temperatures, and microarray hybridizations were performed to determine changes in gene expression patterns. This first large-scale transcriptomic study of a kelp species shows that S. latissima responds to temperature and light stress with a multitude of transcriptional changes: up to 32\% of genes showed an altered expression after the exposure experiments. High temperature had stronger effects on gene expression in S. latissima than low temperature, reflected by the higher number of temperature-responsive genes. We gained insights into underlying molecular processes of acclimation, which includes adjustment of the primary metabolism as well as induction of several {ROS} scavengers and a sophisticated regulation of Hsps. We show that S. latissima, as a cold adapted species, must make stronger efforts for acclimating to high than to low temperatures. The strongest response was caused by the combination of high temperatures with high light intensities, which proved most harmful for the alga.},

Discontinuities in the response to growth irradiance were revealed for the light- and {CO2-saturated} rate of photosynthesis (P max) and the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b (Chl a/b). Three separate phases in the response of P max and Chl a/b to growth light were evident, with increases at low and high irradiance ranges and a plateau at intermediate irradiance. By measuring all chlorophyll-containing components of the thylakoid membrane that contribute to Chl a/b we reveal that distinct strategies for growth at low and high irradiance underlie the discontinuous response. These strategies include, in addition to changes in the major light-harvesting complexes of photosystem {II} ({LHCII)}, large shifts in the amounts of both reaction centres as well as significant changes in the levels of minor {LHCII} and {LHCI} components.},

Plants were grown under low irradiance with a shade-type spectrum ({LFR:} 50μmol quanta m–2 s–1), moderately high white light ({MW:} 300μmol quanta m–2 s–1) and low irradiance white light ({LW:} 50μmol quanta m–2 s–1). The effects of light quality upon chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity were found to be species-dependent. A far-red dependent reduction in chlorophyll was found in three species, and an irradiance-dependent reduction was found in B. sylvaticum, which showed the greatest alteration in the xanthophyll cycle pool size of all species tested under these conditions. Chlorophyll a/b ratios were sensitive to both light quality and quantity in C. angustifolium and D. purpurea, being highest in {MW}, lowest in {LFR}, and intermediate in {LW}, whilst the other species showed no response. Ratios of photosystem {II} to photosystem I ({PSII} and {PSI)} demonstrated a strong irradiance-associated increase in all species except B. sylvaticum, whereas an increase in {PSII/PSI} in {LFR} compared to {LW} conditions was present in all species. A change in chlorophyll a/b was not always associated with a change in {PSII/PSI}, suggesting that the level of {LHCII} associated with each {PSII} varied in some species. Cytochrome f content showed an irradiance-dependent effect only, indicating a relationship with the capacity of electron transport. It is concluded that differing strategies of acclimation to the light environment demonstrated by these species results from differing strengths of expression of a series of independently regulated changes in the levels of photosynthetic components.},

	abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been used to study the long-term responses of photosynthesis to high irradiance focusing on the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus and leaf morphology. Typical sun/shade differences in chloroplast composition are seen in the fifth leaf following growth in high irradiance compared with low irradiance (1000 and 200 μmol m−2 s−1, respectively): higher light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (Pmax), higher amounts of Rubisco protein, and a lower chlorophyll a:b ratio. In addition, leaves were thicker under high light compared with low light. However, responses appear more complex when leaf developmental stage is considered. Using a system of transferring plants from low to high light in the laboratory responses that occur before and after full leaf extension have been studied. Acclimation of photosynthesis is limited by leaf age: the transfer to high light, post-leaf extension, is characterized by alterations in chlorophyll a:b but not in Rubisco protein, which may be limited by leaf morphology. Microarray analysis of gene expression was carried out on plants that were transferred to high light post-leaf extension. A down-regulation of light-harvesting genes was seen. No change in the expression level of Rubisco genes was observed. Up-regulation of genes involved in photoprotection was observed. It was also shown that high-light leaf morphology is established prior to formation of the zone of cellular elongation and division. The endogenous and environmental factors which establish the characteristics of high light acclimation may be important for attaining high rates of assimilation in leaves and crop canopies, and the fifth leaf in rice provides a convenient model system for the determination of the mechanisms involved.},

Modulation of this novel, chloroplastic redox signal either by excess light or by low temperature initiates a signal transduction pathway. This appears to coordinate photosynthesis-related gene expression and to influence the nuclear expression of a specific cold-acclimation gene, plant morphology and differentiation in cyanobacteria. Thus, in addition to its traditional role in energy transduction, the photosynthetic apparatus might also be an environmental sensor.},

The regulation of light harvesting involves the photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the light-harvesting antenna complexes ({LHCs)} as heat. Here, we report an investigation into the structural basis of light-harvesting regulation in intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts using freeze-fracture electron microscopy, combined with laser confocal microscopy employing the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. The results demonstrate that formation of the photoprotective state requires a structural reorganization of the photosynthetic membrane involving dissociation of {LHCII} from {PSII} and its aggregation. The structural changes are manifested by a reduced mobility of {LHC} antenna chlorophyll proteins. It is demonstrated that these changes occur rapidly and reversibly within 5 min of illumination and dark relaxation, are dependent on {ΔpH}, and are enhanced by the deepoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that higher plants vary the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in response to the prevailing environmental conditions, with particular attention being paid to the responses to incident light. Under high light conditions there are increases in the amounts of photosystems, electron transport and {ATP} synthase complexes, and enzymes of the {Calvin–Benson} cycle; conversely, under low light there is an increase in the relative amounts of light-harvesting complexes ({LHC)} and in the stacking of thylakoid membranes to form grana. It is believed that these changes are of adaptive significance, and in a few instances evidence has been provided that this is indeed the case; an increase in photosynthetic capacity reduces susceptibility to photodamage, while changes in photosystem stoichiometry serve to optimize light utilization. By contrast, the potential benefit to the plant of other changes in chloroplast composition, such as in the levels of {LHC}, is far less clear. It is also believed that redox signals derived from photosynthetic electron transport play an important regulatory role in acclimation. However, while there is convincing evidence that such redox signals modulate the expression of many plastidic and nuclear genes encoding photosynthetic components, there is little to demonstrate that such changes are responsible for regulating chloroplast composition. This review discusses the evidence that particular aspects of acclimation are advantageous to the plant, and highlights the significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying acclimation.},

	abstract = {Summary Traditional genetic mapping has largely focused on the identification of loci affecting one, or at most a few, complex traits. Microarrays allow for measurement of thousands of gene expression abundances, themselves complex traits, and a number of recent investigations have considered these measurements as phenotypes in mapping studies. Combining traditional quantitative trait loci ({QTL)} mapping methods with microarray data is a powerful approach with demonstrated utility in a number of recent biological investigations. These expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL)} studies are similar to traditional {QTL} studies, as a main goal is to identify the genomic locations to which the expression traits are linked. However, {eQTL} studies probe thousands of expression transcripts; and as a result, standard multi-trait {QTL} mapping methods, designed to handle at most tens of traits, do not directly apply. One possible approach is to use single-trait {QTL} mapping methods to analyze each transcript separately. This leads to an increased number of false discoveries, as corrections for multiple tests across transcripts are not made. Similarly, the repeated application, at each marker, of methods for identifying differentially expressed transcripts suffers from multiple tests across markers. Here, we demonstrate the deficiencies of these approaches and propose a mixture over markers ({MOM)} model that shares information across both markers and transcripts. The utility of all methods is evaluated using simulated data as well as data from an F2 mouse cross in a study of diabetes. Results from simulation studies indicate that the {MOM} model is best at controlling false discoveries, without sacrificing power. The {MOM} model is also the only one capable of finding two genome regions previously shown to be involved in diabetes.},

	doi = {10.1017/S175173111200002X},
	abstract = {This paper examines the relative importance of productive and adaptive traits in beef breeding systems based on Bos taurus and tropically adapted breeds across temperate and (sub)tropical environments. In the (sub)tropics, differences that exist between breeds in temperate environments are masked by the effects of environmental stressors. Hence in tropical environments, breeds are best categorised into breed types to compare their performance across environments. Because of the presence of environmental stressors, there are more sources of genetic variation in tropical breeding programmes. It is therefore necessary to examine the genetic basis of productive and adaptive traits for breeding programmes in those environments. This paper reviews the heritabilities and genetic relationships between economically important productive and adaptive traits relevant to (sub)tropical breeding programmes. It is concluded that it is possible to simultaneously genetically improve productive and adaptive traits in tropically adapted breeds of beef cattle grazed in tropical environments without serious detrimental consequences for either adaptation or production. However, breed-specific parameters are required for genetic evaluations. The paper also reviews the magnitude of genotype × environment (G × E) interactions impacting on production and adaptation of cattle, where ‘genotype’ is defined as breed (within a crossbreeding system), sire within breed (in a within-breed selection programme) or associations between economically important traits and single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs} – within a marker-assisted selection programme). It is concluded that re-ranking of breeds across environments is best managed by the use of the breed type(s) best suited to the particular production environment. Re-ranking of sires across environments is apparent in poorly adapted breed types across extreme tropical and temperate environments or where breeding animals are selected in a temperate environment for use in the (sub)tropics. However, G × E interactions are unlikely to be of major importance in tropically adapted beef cattle grazed in either temperate or (sub)tropical environments, although sex × environment interactions may provide new opportunities for differentially selecting to simultaneously improve steer performance in benign environments and female performance in harsher environments. Early evidence suggests that re-ranking of {SNPs} occurs across temperate and tropical environments, although their magnitude is still to be confirmed in well-designed experiments. The major limitation to genetic improvement of beef cattle over the next decade is likely to be a deficiency of large numbers of accurately recorded phenotypes for most productive and adaptive traits and, in particular, for difficult-to-measure adaptive traits such as resistance to disease and environmental stressors.},

There was highly significant genetic variation for life span within each sex and environment. In the analysis of variance of life span pooled over sexes and environments, however, the significant genetic variation appeared in the genotype × sex and genotype × environment interaction terms. The genetic correlation of longevity across the sexes and environments was not significantly different from zero in these lines. We estimated map positions and effects of {QTL} affecting life span by linkage to highly polymorphic roo transposable element markers, using a multiple-trait composite interval mapping procedure. A minimum of 17 {QTL} were detected; all were sex and/or environment-specific. Ten of the {QTL} had sexually antagonistic or antagonistic pleiotropic effects in different environments. These data provide support for the pleiotropy theory of senescence and the hypothesis that variation for longevity might be maintained by opposing selection pressures in males and females and variable environments. Further work is necessary to assess the generality of these results, using different strains, to determine heterozygous effects and to map the life span {QTL} to the level of genetic loci.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryGenetic} variation for resistance to infection is ubiquitous in natural animal and plant populations. This observation runs counter to intuition that resistance should be an important determinant of fitness, and that alleles conferring low resistance should be eliminated by natural selection. We use the model insect Drosophila melanogaster to test the hypotheses that species-wide genetic variation for resistance may be maintained by a) adaptation of subpopulations to their local environmental conditions (temperature), b) genotype-by-environment interactions ({GxE)} determining resistance, and c) correlated fitness costs of resistance, or life history tradeoffs. We measure resistance to bacterial infection and fecundity at three experimental temperatures in D. melanogaster collected from three environmentally distinct subpopulations. Indeed, we find that flies from a tropical African subpopulation are, on average, less resistant to infection and less fecund at low temperature than are flies from temperate and semi-temperate populations in North America. We observe considerable {GxE} for both traits in all populations. Although individual flies are less fecund when they have more severe infections, the genetic correlations between resistance and fecundity are either positive or nonsignificant under our experimental conditions, so we do not find evidence of a life history tradeoff. We conclude that adaptation to local abiotic environment and {GxE} may maintain species-wide genetic variation for resistance to infection (and fecundity) in D. melanogaster, and by logical extension, other species.},

	abstract = {The interaction of genotype with environment is of primary importance in many aspects of genomic research and is a special priority in the study of major crops grown in a wide range of environments. Water deficit, the major factor limiting plant growth and crop productivity worldwide, is expected to increase with the spread of arid lands. In genetically equivalent cotton populations grown under well-watered and water-limited conditions (the latter is responsible for yield reduction of ∼50\% relative to well-watered conditions), productivity and quality were shown to be partly accounted for by different quantitative trait loci ({QTLs)}, indicating that adaptation to both arid and favorable conditions can be combined in the same genotype. {QTL} mapping was also used to test the association between productivity and quality under water deficit with a suite of traits often found to differ between genotypes adapted to arid versus well-watered conditions. In this study, only reduced plant osmotic potential was clearly implicated in improved cotton productivity under arid conditions. Genomic tools and approaches may expedite breeding of genotypes that respond favorably to specific environments, help test roles of additional physiological factors, and guide the isolation of genes that protect crop performance under arid conditions toward improved adaptation of crops to arid cultivation.},

This includes the phosphorylation and migration of light-harvesting complex {II} ({LHCII)} proteins (state transitions or short-term response) as well as long-term alterations in thylakoid composition (long-term response or {LTR).} Both responses require the thylakoid protein kinase {STN7.} Here, we show that the signaling pathways triggering state transitions and {LTR} diverge at, or immediately downstream from, {STN7.} Both responses require {STN7} activity that can be regulated according to the plastoquinone pool redox state. However, {LTR} signaling does not involve {LHCII} phosphorylation or any other state transition step. State transitions appear to play a prominent role in flowering plants, and the ability to perform state transitions becomes critical for photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that are impaired in thylakoid electron transport but retain a functional {LTR.} Our data imply that {STN7-dependent} phosphorylation of an as yet unknown thylakoid protein triggers {LTR} signaling events, whereby an involvement of the {TSP9} protein in the signaling pathway could be excluded. The {LTR} signaling events then ultimately regulate in chloroplasts the expression of photosynthesis-related genes on the transcript level, whereas expression of nuclear-encoded proteins is regulated at multiple levels, as indicated by transcript and protein profiling in {LTR} mutants.},

	abstract = {When plants are exposed to light levels higher than those required for photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species are generated in the chloroplasts and cause photodamage. This can occur even under natural growth conditions. To mitigate photodamage, plants have developed several protective mechanisms. One is chloroplast avoidance movement, in which chloroplasts move from the cell surface to the side walls of cells under high light conditions, although experimental support is still awaited. Here, using different classes of mutant defective in chloroplast avoidance movement, we show that these mutants are more susceptible to damage in high light than wild-type plants. Damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and subsequent bleaching of leaf colour and necrosis occur faster under high light conditions in the mutants than in wild-type plants. We conclude that chloroplast avoidance movement actually decreases the amount of light absorption by chloroplasts, and might therefore be important to the survival of plants under natural growth conditions.},

Measurements were made on wild-type ({WT)} plants and npq4 mutant plants deficient in non-photochemical quenching ({NPQ).} Two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, {WT} and mutant warm-grown plants were exposed to three different irradiance regimes [75, 150 and 300 µmol photosynthetically active radiation ({PAR)]}, and leaf dark respiration was measured in conjunction with {PSII} redox poise. In the second experiment, {WT} and mutant warm-grown plants were shifted to 5 {°C} and 75, 150 or 300 µmol {PAR}, and dark respiration was measured alongside {PSII} redox poise in cold-treated and cold-developed leaves. Despite significant differences in {PSII} redox poise between genotypes and irradiance treatments, neither genotype nor growth irradiance had any effect upon the rate of respiration in warm-grown, cold-treated or cold-developed leaves. We conclude that changes in {PSII} redox poise, at least within the range experienced here, have no direct impacts on rates of leaf dark respiration, and that the respiratory cold acclimation response is unrelated to changes in chloroplast redox poise.},

A high amount of anthocyanin pigments, 3.0 {g/L}, was obtained in a bubble column bioreactor after 10 days of cultivation at an aeration rate of 0.1 vvm with light irradiation at 27.2 W/m2, while 2 {g/L} was obtained at 13.6 W/m2 and very little at 54.4 W/m2. A high amount of anthocyanin pigments, 2.9 {g/L}, was also produced using an aerated and agitated bioreactor at an agitation speed of 130 rpm, an aeration rate of 0.1 vvm and light irradiation intensity of 27.2 W/m2. The amount of anthocyanin produced was more than twice that without light irradiation, Keeping the other cultivation conditions the same. The results obtained also showed that the amount of anthocyanin pigment accumulated in a shake flask could be rather well reproduced in bioreactors for both aerated culture, and aerated and agitated culture, by improving the conditions of light irradiation, which conspicuously affects metabolite formation.},

As leaf water content ({LWC)} decreased, metabolic concentrations (Pro, {SS}, and An) increased and were negatively and significantly correlated with {LWC.} Thus, these metabolites may have an important role in the acclimation process to drought stress ({DS).} No correlations among Pro, {SS} and An accumulation with the quantum efficiency of {PSII} photochemistry ({ΦPSII)} and the excitation pressure (1 − {qP)} were observed under {DS.} This implies that, while metabolites increased in a drought-dependent way, {PSII} activity did not decrease in the same pattern. Our results indicated that, under {MoDS}, A. thaliana leaves were able to maintain oxidative compounds such as malondialdeyde, an end product of lipid peroxidation, within the range of control leaves, and to cope with oxidative damage, as was evident by the decreased excitation pressure (1 − {qP)} and similar (ns difference) {ΦPSII} to that of control leaves. In addition, a statistically significant increased accumulation of Pro, {SS} and An was recorded only under {MoDS} compared to controls. The better {PSII} functioning of {MoDS} Arabidopsis leaves may reflect the greater capacity of these leaves to undertake key metabolic adjustments, including increased Pro, {SS} and An accumulation, to maintain a higher antioxidant protection and a better balance between light capture and energy use.},

All the anthocyanins were exclusively cyanidins or peonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucosides and their acylated derivatives. The total anthocyanin content in purple sweet potato powder obtained by solid-phase extraction was 66 mg g−1. A strong capacity of purple sweet potato anthocyanins ({PSPA)} to scavenge reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydroxyl radical) and the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl organic free radical was found in vitro using the electron spin resonance technique. To determine the functional roles of anthocyanins in leaves in vivo, for the first time, supplemental anthocyanins were infiltrated into leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana double mutant of the ecotype Landsberg erecta (tt3tt4) deficient in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed that anthocyanins significantly ameliorated the inactivation of photosystems {II} during prolonged high-light (1300 µmol m−2 s−1) exposure. Comet assay of {DNA} revealed an obvious role of supplemental {PSPA} in alleviating {DNA} damage by high light in leaves.

Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids, act as an effective screening mechanism that allows plant survival and proliferation under occasional periods of harmful irradiation through modulation of light absorption. Apart from light-sensing through photoreceptors such as phytochrome and cryptochrome, plants use the photosynthetic electron transfer ({PET)} chain to integrate light information. The redox status of the plastoquinone ({PQ)} pool of the {PET} chain regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, together with the plant hormone ethylene and plant hormone-like sugars. A complex signaling apparatus in acyanic cells appears to transduce information to cyanic cells to regulate anthocyanin production through an intercellular signaling pathway that remains largely uncharacterized.

This approach has been criticised for ignoring biological knowledge regarding how genes work together. Recently a series of methods, that do incorporate biological knowledge, have been proposed. However, the most popular method, gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA)}, seems overly complicated. Furthermore, {GSEA} is based on a statistical test known for its lack of sensitivity.

This necessitated the development of novel experimental systems to investigate the initiation, perception, and response to {HL} {SAA.} These systems were used to investigate the {HL} {SAA} response by monitoring the induction of {mRNA} in distal leaves not exposed to the {HL} stress. Acclimation to {HL} is induced within minutes and the response is proportionally dependent on the quality and quantity of light. {HL} {SAA} treatments in conjunction with variations in temperature and humidity reveal {HL} {SAA} is influenced by fluctuations in humidity. These treatments also result in changes in auxin accumulation and auxin-responsive genes. A key question in retrograde signaling is the extent to which transient changes in light intensity result in a “memory” of the event leading to acclimation responses. Repeated exposure to short term {HL} resulted in acclimation of the exposed tissue and that of emerging and young leaves (but not older leaves) to {HL} and oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Studying the genetic regulation of expression variation is a key method to dissect complex phenotypic traits. To examine the genetic architecture of regulatory variation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed genome-wide association ({GWA)} mapping of gene expression in an F1 hybrid diversity panel. At a genome-wide false discovery rate ({FDR)} of 0.2, an associated single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} explains {\textgreater}38\% of trait variation. In comparison with {SNPs} that are distant from the genes to which they were associated, locally associated {SNPs} are preferentially found in regions with extended linkage disequilibrium ({LD)} and have distinct population frequencies of the derived alleles (where Arabidopsis lyrata has the ancestral allele), suggesting that different selective forces are acting. Locally associated {SNPs} tend to have additive inheritance, whereas distantly associated {SNPs} are primarily dominant. In contrast to results from mapping of expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL)} in linkage studies, we observe extensive allelic heterogeneity for local regulatory loci in our diversity panel. By association mapping of allele-specific expression ({ASE)}, we detect a significant enrichment for cis-acting variation in local regulatory variation. In addition to gene expression variation, association mapping of splicing variation reveals both local and distant genetic regulation for intron and exon level traits. Finally, we identify candidate genes for 59 diverse phenotypic traits that were mapped to {eQTL.}},

Previous studies indicated that depending on the type of {ROS} (hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, or singlet oxygen) or its subcellular production site (plastidic, cytosolic, peroxisomal, or apoplastic), a different physiological, biochemical, and molecular response is provoked. We used transcriptome data generated from {ROS-related} microarray experiments to assess the specificity of {ROS-driven} transcript expression. Data sets obtained by exogenous application of oxidative stress-causing agents (methyl viologen, Alternaria alternata toxin, 3-aminotriazole, and ozone) and from a mutant (fluorescent) and transgenic plants, in which the activity of an individual antioxidant enzyme was perturbed (catalase, cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase, and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase), were compared. In total, the abundance of nearly 26,000 transcripts of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was monitored in response to different {ROS.} Overall, 8,056, 5,312, and 3,925 transcripts showed at least a 3-, 4-, or 5-fold change in expression, respectively. In addition to marker transcripts that were specifically regulated by hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, or singlet oxygen, several transcripts were identified as general oxidative stress response markers because their steady-state levels were at least 5-fold elevated in most experiments. We also assessed the expression characteristics of all annotated transcription factors and inferred new candidate regulatory transcripts that could be responsible for orchestrating the specific transcriptomic signatures triggered by different {ROS.} Our analysis provides a framework that will assist future efforts to address the impact of {ROS} signals within environmental stress conditions and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the oxidative stress response in plants.},

	abstract = {Exposure of Arabidopsis plants that were maintained under low light (200 mumol of photons m-2 sec-1) to excess light (2000 mumol of photons m-2 sec-1) for 1 hr caused reversible photoinhibition of photosynthesis. Measurements of photosynthetic parameters and the use of electron transport inhibitors indicated that a novel signal transduction pathway was initiated at plastoquinone and regulated, at least in part, by the redox status of the plastoquinone pool. This signal, which preceded the photooxidative burst of hydrogen peroxide ({H2O2)} associated with photoinhibition of photosynthesis, resulted in a rapid increase (within 15 min) in {mRNA} levels of two cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase genes ({APX1} and {APX2).} Treatment of leaves with exogenous reduced glutathione abolished this signal, suggesting that glutathione or the redox status of the glutathione pool has a regulatory impact on this signaling pathway. During recovery from photooxidative stress, transcripts for cytosolic glutathione reductase ({GOR2)} increased, emphasizing the role of glutathione in this stress.
Plants perceive and respond to environmental stresses with complex mechanisms that are often associated with the activation of antioxidant defenses. A genetic screen aimed at isolating oxidative stress-tolerant lines of Arabidopsis thaliana has identified oxt1, a line that exhibits improved tolerance to oxidative stress and elevated temperature but displays no apparent deleterious growth effects under non-stress conditions. Oxt1 harbors a mutation that arises from the altered expression of a gene encoding adenine phosphoribosyltransferase ({APT1)}, an enzyme that converts adenine to adenosine monophosphate ({AMP)}, indicating a link between purine metabolism, whole-plant growth responses, and stress acclimation. The oxt1 mutation results in decreased {APT1} expression that leads to reduced enzymatic activity. Correspondingly, oxt1 plants possess elevated levels of adenine. Decreased {APT} enzyme activity directly correlates with stress resistance in transgenic lines that ectopically express {APT1.} The metabolic alteration in oxt1 plants also alters the expression of several antioxidant defense genes and the response of these genes to oxidative challenge. Finally, it is shown that manipulation of adenine levels can induce stress tolerance to wild-type plants. Collectively, these results show that alterations in cellular adenine levels can trigger stress tolerance and improve growth, leading to increases in plant biomass. The results also suggest that adenine might play a part in the signals that modulate responses to abiotic stress and plant growth.},

They bind to the consensus sequence {‘nGAAnnTCCn’} found in the promoters of many defence genes, and are thought to function as a highly redundant and flexible gene network that controls the response of plants to different environmental stress conditions, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Hsf proteins encoded by different genes exhibit a high degree of complexity in their interactions. They can potentially bind and activate their own promoters, as well as the promoters of other members of their gene family, and they can form homo- or heterotrimers resulting in altered nuclear localization, as well as enhanced or suppressed transcription., • Scope In this review, we summarize recent studies on Hsf function in Arabidopsis and tomato and present evidence obtained from microarray expression studies in Arabidopsis that the Hsf gene network is highly flexible and specialized, with specific members and/or member combinations controlling the response of plants to particular stress conditions. In addition, we describe recent studies that support the hypothesis that certain Hsfs function as molecular sensors that directly sense reactive oxygen species ({ROS)} and control the expression of oxidative stress response genes during oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Quantification of {mRNAs} using real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} by monitoring the product formation with the fluorescent dye {SYBR} Green I is being extensively used in neurosciences, developmental biology, and medical diagnostics. Most {PCR} data analysis procedures assume that the {PCR} efficiency for the amplicon of interest is constant or even, in the case of the comparative C(t) method, equal to 2. The latter method already leads to a 4-fold error when the {PCR} efficiencies vary over just a 0.04 range. {PCR} efficiencies of amplicons are usually calculated from standard curves based on either known {RNA} inputs or on dilution series of a reference {cDNA} sample. In this paper we show that the first approach can lead to {PCR} efficiencies that vary over a 0.2 range, whereas the second approach may be off by 0.26. Therefore, we propose linear regression on the Log(fluorescence) per cycle number data as an assumption-free method to calculate starting concentrations of {mRNAs} and {PCR} efficiencies for each sample.

{RESULTS:} To compare the performance of six techniques which are currently used for analysing fluorescent data in real-time {PCR} relative quantification, we quantified four cytokine transcripts ({IL-1beta}, {IL-6} {TNF-alpha}, and {GM-CSF)} in an in vivo model of colonic inflammation. Accuracy of the methods was tested by quantification on samples with known relative amounts of target {mRNAs.} Reproducibility of the methods was estimated by the determination of the intra-assay and inter-assay variability. Cytokine expression normalized to the expression of three reference genes ({ACTB}, {HPRT}, {SDHA)} was then determined using the six methods for data analysis. The best results were obtained with the relative standard curve method, comparative Ct method and with {DART-PCR}, {LinRegPCR} and Liu \& Saint exponential methods when average amplification efficiency was used. The use of individual amplification efficiencies in {DART-PCR}, {LinRegPCR} and Liu \& Saint exponential methods significantly impaired the results. The sigmoid curve-fitting ({SCF)} method produced medium performance; the results indicate that the use of appropriate type of fluorescence data and in some instances manual selection of the number of amplification cycles included in the analysis is necessary when the {SCF} method is applied. We also compared amplification efficiencies (E) and found that although the E values determined by different methods of analysis were not identical, all the methods were capable to identify two genes whose E values significantly differed from other genes.
{CONCLUSION:} Our results show that all the tested methods can provide quantitative values reflecting the amounts of measured {mRNA} in samples, but they differ in their accuracy and reproducibility. Selection of the appropriate method can also depend on the design of a particular experiment. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods in different applications are discussed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} {PCR} has the potential to detect and precisely quantify specific {DNA} sequences, but it is not yet often used as a fully quantitative method. A number of data collection and processing strategies have been described for the implementation of quantitative {PCR.} However, they can be experimentally cumbersome, their relative performances have not been evaluated systematically, and they often remain poorly validated statistically and/or experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the performance of known methods, and compared them with newly developed data processing strategies in terms of resolution, precision and robustness.
{RESULTS:} Our results indicate that simple methods that do not rely on the estimation of the efficiency of the {PCR} amplification may provide reproducible and sensitive data, but that they do not quantify {DNA} with precision. Other evaluated methods based on sigmoidal or exponential curve fitting were generally of both poor resolution and precision. A statistical analysis of the parameters that influence efficiency indicated that it depends mostly on the selected amplicon and to a lesser extent on the particular biological sample analyzed. Thus, we devised various strategies based on individual or averaged efficiency values, which were used to assess the regulated expression of several genes in response to a growth factor.
{CONCLUSION:} Overall, {qPCR} data analysis methods differ significantly in their performance, and this analysis identifies methods that provide {DNA} quantification estimates of high precision, robustness and reliability. These methods allow reliable estimations of relative expression ratio of two-fold or higher, and our analysis provides an estimation of the number of biological samples that have to be analyzed to achieve a given precision.},

	abstract = {{RNA} transcripts such as {mRNA} or {microRNA} are frequently used as biomarkers to determine disease state or response to therapy. Reverse transcription ({RT)} in combination with quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} has become the method of choice to quantify small amounts of such {RNA} molecules. In parallel with the democratization of {RT-qPCR} and its increasing use in biomedical research or biomarker discovery, we witnessed a growth in the number of gene expression data analysis methods. Most of these methods are based on the principle that the position of the amplification curve with respect to the cycle-axis is a measure for the initial target quantity: the later the curve, the lower the target quantity. However, most methods differ in the mathematical algorithms used to determine this position, as well as in the way the efficiency of the {PCR} reaction (the fold increase of product per cycle) is determined and applied in the calculations. Moreover, there is dispute about whether the {PCR} efficiency is constant or continuously decreasing. Together this has lead to the development of different methods to analyze amplification curves. In published comparisons of these methods, available algorithms were typically applied in a restricted or outdated way, which does not do them justice. Therefore, we aimed at development of a framework for robust and unbiased assessment of curve analysis performance whereby various publicly available curve analysis methods were thoroughly compared using a previously published large clinical data set (Vermeulen et al., 2009) [11]. The original developers of these methods applied their algorithms and are co-author on this study. We assessed the curve analysis methods' impact on transcriptional biomarker identification in terms of expression level, statistical significance, and patient-classification accuracy. The concentration series per gene, together with data sets from unpublished technical performance experiments, were analyzed in order to assess the algorithms' precision, bias, and resolution. While large differences exist between methods when considering the technical performance experiments, most methods perform relatively well on the biomarker data. The data and the analysis results per method are made available to serve as benchmark for further development and evaluation of {qPCR} curve analysis methods ({http://qPCRDataMethods.hfrc.nl).}},

But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time {RT–PCR} of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time {PCR} efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to {RNA} integrity, sample loading and inter-{PCR} variations. High accuracy and reproducibility ({\textless}2.5\% variation) were reached in {LightCycler} {PCR} using the established mathematical model.},

	abstract = {For real-time monitoring of {PCR} amplification of {DNA}, quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} assays use various fluorescent reporters. {DNA} binding molecules and hybridization reporters (primers and probes) only fluoresce when bound to {DNA} and result in the non-cumulative increase in observed fluorescence. Hydrolysis reporters ({TaqMan} probes and {QZyme} primers) become fluorescent during {DNA} elongation and the released fluorophore remains fluorescent during further cycles; this results in a cumulative increase in observed fluorescence. Although the quantification threshold is reached at a lower number of cycles when fluorescence accumulates, in {qPCR} analysis no distinction is made between the two types of data sets. Mathematical modeling shows that ignoring the cumulative nature of the data leaves the estimated {PCR} efficiency practically unaffected but will lead to at least one cycle underestimation of the quantification cycle (C(q) value), corresponding to a 2-fold overestimation of target quantity. The effect on the target-reference ratio depends on the {PCR} efficiency of the target and reference amplicons. The leftward shift of the C(q) value is dependent on the {PCR} efficiency and with sufficiently large C(q) values, this shift is constant. This allows the C(q) to be corrected and unbiased target quantities to be obtained.},

	abstract = {Exposure of plants to light intensities higher than those required to saturate photosynthesis leads to a reduction in photosynthetic capacity. This effect is known as photoinhibition. Photoinhibition is followed by destruction of carotenoids, bleaching of chlorophylls and increased lipid peroxidation due to damage by oxygen-derivatives. The oxygen concentration in chloroplasts in the light is high because of oxygen production by photosystem {II} ({PSII).} This can result in the release of reactive intermediates of reduced dioxygen such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide or singlet oxygen. In order to maintain their normal function under light stress conditions, chloroplasts have developed multiple repair and protection systems. The induction of specific light stress proteins, the {ELIPs} (for early light-induced proteins) can be considered to be part of these protective responses. The accumulation of {ELIPs} under light stress conditions is correlated with the photoinactivation of {PSII}, degradation of the Dl-protein of {PSII} reaction centre and changes in the level of pigments. Futhermore, the accumulation of {ELIPs} in the thylakoids is strictly controlled by the pigment content, especially by chlorophylls. Isolation of {ELIPs} in a native form and analysis of pigments bound to these proteins revealed that {ELIPs} can bind chlorophyll a and lutein. These data indicate that {ELIPs} might represent unique chlorophyll-binding proteins which have a transient function(s) during light stress. A transient ‘pigment-carrier’ function is postulated for {ELIPs.}},

	abstract = {Plant responses to different stresses are highly complex and involve changes at the transcriptome, cellular, and physiological levels. Recent evidence shows that plants respond to multiple stresses differently from how they do to individual stresses, activating a specific programme of gene expression relating to the exact environmental conditions encountered. Rather than being additive, the presence of an abiotic stress can have the effect of reducing or enhancing susceptibility to a biotic pest or pathogen, and vice versa. This interaction between biotic and abiotic stresses is orchestrated by hormone signalling pathways that may induce or antagonize one another, in particular that of abscisic acid. Specificity in multiple stress responses is further controlled by a range of molecular mechanisms that act together in a complex regulatory network. Transcription factors, kinase cascades, and reactive oxygen species are key components of this cross-talk, as are heat shock factors and small {RNAs.} This review aims to characterize the interaction between biotic and abiotic stress responses at a molecular level, focusing on regulatory mechanisms important to both pathways. Identifying master regulators that connect both biotic and abiotic stress response pathways is fundamental in providing opportunities for developing broad-spectrum stress-tolerant crop plants.},

However, in their natural habitats plants are simultaneously subjected to a broad range of abiotic and biotic stimuli which influence photosynthetic efficiency; hence there is an emerging need to examine the process of photosynthesis under multivariable field conditions in order to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie its regulation. Such knowledge has potential for providing novel targets that would improve both crop yield and performance. In the present study we compared laboratory- and field-grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants in terms of photosynthetic efficiency in modulated light intensities and {CO2} concentrations. We show here that the field-acclimated plants display highly efficient photosynthesis and are more tolerant to variable light intensities and {CO2} concentrations than their laboratory-grown counterparts. We also demonstrate that some structural rearrangements of {LHCII} and {PSII}, together with altered pigments composition and stomatal density, are responsible for the differences in assimilation and photochemistry. Furthermore, we employ a transcript profiling approach to explain the genetic mechanisms underlying these adaptations and suggest that they are mainly induced by the high and fluctuating light intensities which occur in the natural environment.},

The procedure can be completed in less than eight hours. Yield and purity were monitored by denaturing gel electrophoresis and by {UV} absorbance (A260 {/A280} and {A260/A230).} These ratios were over 2, indicating an absence of contaminating metabolites. Additionally, a new absorbance ratio ({A260/A210)} was introduced to monitor the {RNA} purity in each step (it indicates the ratio of covalent links in the solution belonging to {RNA).} The yield was around 300 µg total {RNA} per gram of tissue of Pinus sylvestris and over 400 µg of total {RNA} per gram of P. pinaster tissue, which is a high recovery (more than 63\%) for gymnosperms.

While detailed analysis of a single individual typically requires deep sequencing, when many individuals are sequenced it is possible to combine shallow sequence data across individuals to generate accurate calls in shared stretches of chromosome. Here, we show that, as progressively larger numbers of individuals are sequenced, increasingly accurate genotype calls can be generated for a given sequence depth. We evaluate the implications of low-coverage sequencing for complex trait association studies. We systematically compare study designs based on genotyping of {tagSNPs}, sequencing of many individuals at depths ranging between 2× and 30×, and imputation of variants discovered by sequencing a subset of individuals into the remainder of the sample. We show that sequencing many individuals at low depth is an attractive strategy for studies of complex trait genetics. For example, for disease-associated variants with frequency {\textgreater}0.2\%, sequencing 3000 individuals at 4× depth provides similar power to deep sequencing of {\textgreater}2000 individuals at 30× depth but requires only ∼20\% of the sequencing effort. We also show low-coverage sequencing can be used to build a reference panel that can drive imputation into additional samples to increase power further. We provide guidance for investigators wishing to combine results from sequenced, genotyped, and imputed samples.},

However, the extensive dynamic range of gene expression, technical limitations and biases, as well as the observed complexity of the transcriptional landscape pose profound computational challenges for transcriptome reconstruction.
Results: We present the novel framework {MITIE} (Mixed Integer Transcript {IdEntification)} for simultaneous transcript reconstruction and quantification. We define a likelihood function based on the negative binomial distribution, use a regularization approach to select a few transcripts collectively explaining the observed read data, and show how to find the optimal solution using Mixed Integer Programming. {MITIE} can a) take advantage of known transcripts, b) reconstruct and quantify transcripts simultaneously in multiple samples, as well as c) resolve the location of multi-mapping reads. It is designed for genome- and assembly-based transcriptome reconstruction. We present an extensive study based on realistic, simulated {RNA-Seq} data. When compared to state-of-the-art approaches, {MITIE} proves to be significantly more sensitive and overall more accurate. Moreover, {MITIE} yields substantial performance gains when used with multiple samples. We applied our system to 38 D. melanogaster {modENCODE} {RNA-Seq} libraries and estimated the sensitivity of reconstructing omitted transcript annotations and the specificity with respect to annotated transcripts. Our results corroborate that a well-motivated objective paired with appropriate optimization techniques lead to significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in transcriptome reconstruction.

The following conclusions can be drawn. 1.
(1) The {DNA} represented in this random sample is composed predominantly of single-copy sequences. This presumably reflects the organization of the Arabidopsis genome as a whole and supports prior conclusions reached on the basis of kinetics of {DNA} reassociation.
2.
(2) The {DNA} that encodes the ribosomal {RNAs} constitutes the only major class of cloned nuclear repetitive {DNA.} It consists of approximately 570 tandem copies of a heterogeneous 9900-base-pair repeat unit.
3.
(3) There is an average of approximately 660 copies of the chloroplast genome per cell. Therefore, the chloroplast genome constitutes the major component of the repetitive sequences found in A. thaliana {DNA} made from whole plants.
4.
(4) The inner cytosine residue in the sequence C-C-G-G is methylated more often than the outer in the tandem ribosomal {DNA} units, whereas very few differences in the methylation state of these two cytosine residues are detected in unique sequences.},

Drought and heat stress have been extensively studied; however, little is known about how their combination impacts plants. The response of Arabidopsis plants to a combination of drought and heat stress was found to be distinct from that of plants subjected to drought or heat stress. Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis plants subjected to a combination of drought and heat stress revealed a new pattern of defense response in plants that includes a partial combination of two multigene defense pathways (i.e. drought and heat stress), as well as 454 transcripts that are specifically expressed in plants during a combination of drought and heat stress. Metabolic profiling of plants subjected to drought, heat stress, or a combination of drought and heat stress revealed that plants subject to a combination of drought and heat stress accumulated sucrose and other sugars such as maltose and gulose. In contrast, Pro that accumulated in plants subjected to drought did not accumulate in plants during a combination of drought and heat stress. Heat stress was found to ameliorate the toxicity of Pro to cells, suggesting that during a combination of drought and heat stress sucrose replaces Pro in plants as the major osmoprotectant.

Combinations of stresses such as heat and drought or cold and high light intensity have profound effects on crop performance and yields. Thus, delineation of the regulatory networks and metabolic pathways responding to single and multiple concurrent stresses is required for breeding and engineering crop stress tolerance. Many studies have described transcriptome changes in response to single stresses. However, exposure of plants to a combination of stress factors may require agonistic or antagonistic responses or responses potentially unrelated to responses to the corresponding single stresses. To analyze such responses, we initially compared transcriptome changes in 10 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotypes using cold, heat, high-light, salt, and flagellin treatments as single stress factors as well as their double combinations. This revealed that some 61\% of the transcriptome changes in response to double stresses were not predic from the responses to single stress treatments. It also showed that plants prioritized between potentially antagonistic responses for only 5\% to 10\% of the responding transcripts. This indicates that plants have evolved to cope with combinations of stresses and, therefore, may be bred to endure them. In addition, using a subset of this data from the Columbia and Landsberg erecta ecotypes, we have delineated coexpression network modules responding to single and combined stresses.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Current understanding of stomatal development in Arabidopsis thaliana is based on mutations producing aberrant, often lethal phenotypes. The aim was to discover if naturally occurring viable phenotypes would be useful for studying stomatal development in a species that enables further molecular analysis.
Methods Natural variation in stomatal abundance of A. thaliana was explored in two collections comprising 62 wild accessions by surveying adaxial epidermal cell-type proportion (stomatal index) and density (stomatal and pavement cell density) traits in cotyledons and first leaves. Organ size variation was studied in a subset of accessions. For all traits, maternal effects derived from different laboratory environments were evaluated. In four selected accessions, distinct stomatal initiation processes were quantitatively analysed.
Key Results and Conclusions Substantial genetic variation was found for all six stomatal abundance-related traits, which were weakly or not affected by laboratory maternal environments. Correlation analyses revealed overall relationships among all traits. Within each organ, stomatal density highly correlated with the other traits, suggesting common genetic bases. Each trait correlated between organs, supporting supra-organ control of stomatal abundance. Clustering analyses identified accessions with uncommon phenotypic patterns, suggesting differences among genetic programmes controlling the various traits. Variation was also found in organ size, which negatively correlated with cell densities in both organs and with stomatal index in the cotyledon. Relative proportions of primary and satellite lineages varied among the accessions analysed, indicating that distinct developmental components contribute to natural diversity in stomatal abundance. Accessions with similar stomatal indices showed different lineage class ratios, revealing hidden developmental phenotypes and showing that genetic determinants of primary and satellite lineage initiation combine in several ways. This first systematic, comprehensive natural variation survey for stomatal abundance in A. thaliana reveals cryptic developmental genetic variation, and provides relevant relationships amongst stomatal traits and extreme or uncommon accessions as resources for the genetic dissection of stomatal development.},

	abstract = {{DNA} sequence variation is abundant in wild populations. While molecular biologists use genetically homogeneous strains of model organisms to avoid this variation, evolutionary biologists embrace genetic variation as the material of evolution since heritable differences in fitness drive evolutionary change. Yet, the relationship between the phenotypic variation affecting fitness and the genotypic variation producing it is complex. Genetic buffering mechanisms modify this relationship by concealing the effects of genetic and environmental variation on phenotype. Genetic buffering allows the build-up and storage of genetic variation in phenotypically normal populations. When buffering breaks down, thresholds governing the expression of previously silent variation are crossed. At these thresholds, phenotypic differences suddenly appear and are available for selection. Thus, buffering mechanisms modulate evolution and regulate a balance between evolutionary stasis and change. Recent work provides a glimpse of the molecular details governing some types of genetic buffering. {BioEssays} 22:1095–1105, 2000. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Here I model variation that is partially shielded from selection, assuming that unconditionally deleterious variation is more strongly deleterious than variation that is potentially adaptive in a future environment. I find that cryptic genetic variation can be substantially enriched for potential adaptations under a broad range of realistic parameter values, including those applicable to alternative splices and readthrough products generated by the yeast prion [{PSI+].} This enrichment is dramatically stronger when multiple simultaneous changes are required to generate a potentially adaptive phenotype. Cryptic genetic variation is likely to be an effective source of useful adaptations at a time of environmental change, relative to an equivalent source of variation that has not spent time in a hidden state.},

	abstract = {Controlled vocabularies are increasingly used by databases to describe genes and gene products because they facilitate identification of similar genes within an organism or among different organisms. One of The Arabidopsis Information Resource's goals is to associate all Arabidopsis genes with terms developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium that describe the molecular function, biological process, and subcellular location of a gene product. We have also developed terms describing Arabidopsis anatomy and developmental stages and use these to annotate published gene expression data. As of March 2004, we used computational and manual annotation methods to make 85,666 annotations representing 26,624 unique loci. We focus on associating genes to controlled vocabulary terms based on experimental data from the literature and use The Arabidopsis Information Resource-developed {PubSearch} software to facilitate this process. Each annotation is tagged with a combination of evidence codes, evidence descriptions, and references that provide a robust means to assess data quality. Annotation of all Arabidopsis genes will allow quantitative comparisons between sets of genes derived from sources such as microarray experiments. The Arabidopsis annotation data will also facilitate annotation of newly sequenced plant genomes by using sequence similarity to transfer annotations to homologous genes. In addition, complete and up-to-date annotations will make unknown genes easy to identify and target for experimentation. Here, we describe the process of Arabidopsis functional annotation using a variety of data sources and illustrate several ways in which this information can be accessed and used to infer knowledge about Arabidopsis and other plant species.
The complete lack of seed storage protein expression in vegetative tissues and robust expression during embryogenesis makes seed development an ideal system to study tissue-specific expression of genes. The promoter for the Phaseolin (phas) gene, which encodes the major seed storage protein in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), is activated in two sequential steps: Phaseolus vulgaris {ABI3-like} factor (Pv-{ALF)–dependent} potentiation and abscisic acid–mediated activation. In this study, a heterologous in vivo Pv-{ALF/phas-GUS} (for β-glucuronidase) expression system in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was used in conjunction with the powerful {RNA-Seq} approach to capture transcriptional landscapes of phas promoter expression. Remarkably, expression of over 1300 genes from 11 functional categories coincided with changes in the transcriptional status of the phas promoter. Gene network analysis of induced genes and artificial {microRNA–mediated} loss-of-function genetic assays identified transcriptional regulators {RINGLET} 2 ({RLT2)} and {AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE} 5 ({AIL5)} as being essential for phas transcription. Pv-{ALF} binding to the {RLT2} and {AIL5} promoter regions was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. {RLT2} and {AIL5} knockdown lines displayed reduced expression of several endogenous seed genes, suggesting that these factors are involved in activation of endogenous Arabidopsis seed storage gene expression. Overall, the identification of these key factors involved in phas activation provides important insight into the two-step transcriptional regulation of seed-specific gene expression.},

However, in recent years, it has become apparent that plants actively produce {ROIs} as signaling molecules to control processes such as programmed cell death, abiotic stress responses, pathogen defense and systemic signaling. Recent advances including microarray studies and the development of mutants with altered {ROI-scavenging} mechanisms provide new insights into how the steady-state level of {ROIs} are controlled in cells. In addition, key steps of the signal transduction pathway that senses {ROIs} in plants have been identified. These raise several intriguing questions about the relationships between {ROI} signaling, {ROI} stress and the production and scavenging of {ROIs} in the different cellular compartments.},

	abstract = {One of the most solid generalizations of transmission genetics is that the phenotypic variance of populations carrying a major mutation is increased relative to the wild type. At least some part of this higher variance is genetic and due to release of previously hidden variation. Similarly, stressful environments also lead to the expression of hidden variation. These two observations have been considered as evidence that the wild type has evolved robustness against genetic variation, i.e., genetic canalization. In this article we present a general model for the interaction of a major mutation or a novel environment with the additive genetic basis of a quantitative character under stabilizing selection. We introduce an approximation to the genetic variance in mutation-selection-drift balance that includes the previously used stochastic Gaussian and house-of-cards approximations as limiting cases. We then show that the release of hidden genetic variation is a generic property of models with epistasis or genotype-environment interaction, regardless of whether the wild-type genotype is canalized or not. As a consequence, the additive genetic variance increases upon a change in the environment or the genetic background even if the mutant character state is as robust as the wild-type character. Estimates show that this predicted increase can be considerable, in particular in large populations and if there are conditionally neutral alleles at the loci underlying the trait. A brief review of the relevant literature suggests that the assumptions of this model are likely to be generic for polygenic traits. We conclude that the release of hidden genetic variance due to a major mutation or environmental stress does not demonstrate canalization of the wild-type genotype.},

A wild Edinburgh strain of D. melanogaster produced no flies showing a break in the posterior crossvein when bred at 25$^{\textrm{⚬}}$ C., but a certain number occurred (as phenocopies) when the pupae aged 21-23 hours were subjected to 40$^{\textrm{⚬}}$ C. for four hours. 2. Selection was practised for and against the appearance of the phenocopy, and rapid progress occurred in both directions. After about 14 generations of selection, some flies in the upward selected strain were found to show the effect even when not exposed to the heat shock. From these, lines were built up which threw a high proportion of crossveinless individuals when kept continuously at 25$^{\textrm{⚬}}$ C. (and even more at 18$^{\textrm{⚬}}$ C.). 3. The crossveinless character, originally a typical 'acquired character,' has become incorporated into the genetic make up of the selected races. A process of 'genetic assimilation' is described by which this might be supposed to happen; it depends on the tendency of selection not merely to increase the frequency of any favorable character, but also to stabilise its development. A similar suggestion has been advanced by Schmalhausen (1947). 4. The genetic basis of the assimilated crossveinless character is polygenic. There is little evidence of any definite distinction between canalising and switch genes.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing.
Results: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.

Major challenges for biology in the post-genome era are to map the molecular polymorphisms responsible for variation in medically, agriculturally, and evolutionarily important complex traits; and to determine their gene frequencies and their homozygous, heterozygous, epistatic, and pleiotropic effects in multiple environments. The ease with which {QTL} can be mapped to genomic intervals bounded by molecular markers belies the difficulty in matching the {QTL} to a genetic locus. The latter requires high-resolution recombination or linkage disequilibrium mapping to nominate putative candidate genes, followed by genetic and/or functional complementation and gene expression analyses.

Many genomic studies have investigated the relationship between gene polymorphism and factors such as recombination rate or expression pattern. However, the polymorphism of a gene is affected not only by its physical properties or functional constraints but also by natural selection on organisms in their environments. Specifically, if functionally divergent alleles enable adaptation to different environments, locus-specific polymorphism may be maintained by spatially heterogeneous natural selection. To test this hypothesis and estimate the extent to which environmental selection shapes the pattern of genome-wide polymorphism, we define the "environmental relevance" of a gene as the proportion of genetic variation explained by environmental factors, after controlling for population structure. We found substantial effects of environmental relevance on patterns of polymorphism among genes. In addition, the correlation between environmental relevance and gene polymorphism is positive, consistent with the expectation that balancing selection among heterogeneous environments maintains genetic variation at ecologically important genes. Comparison of the gene ontology annotations shows that genes with high environmental relevance are enriched in unknown function categories. These results suggest an important role for environmental factors in shaping genome-wide patterns of polymorphism and indicate another direction of genomic study.},

Many factors, employing genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, are involved in modifying translation termination efficiency in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [{PSI+]}, the prion conformation of Sup35p, one of the translation termination factors in yeast, provides an example of such mechanisms. [{PSI+]} increases readthrough of stop codons. This has the potential to unveil hidden genetic variation that may enhance growth in some yeast strains in certain environments. The specific details of readthrough-dependent phenotypes, however, have remained poorly understood. Here, we used a partial loss-of-function allele of {SUP35}, which increases readthrough of stop codons, and a recently developed linkage mapping technique, X-{QTL}, to map loci underlying readthrough-dependent growth phenotypes in two divergent yeast strains, {BY} (a laboratory strain) and {RM} (a wine strain). We found that readthrough-dependent growth phenotypes are often complex, with multiple loci influencing growth. We also showed that variants in the gene {SKY1} underlie one of the loci detected for readthrough-dependent growth phenotypes in the presence of two chemicals that induce oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Cryptic variation is caused by the robustness of phenotypes to mutations. Cryptic variation has no effect on phenotypes in a given genetic or environmental background, but it can have effects after mutations or environmental change. Because evolutionary adaptation by natural selection requires phenotypic variation, phenotypically revealed cryptic genetic variation may facilitate evolutionary adaptation. This is possible if the cryptic variation happens to be pre-adapted, or “exapted”, to a new environment, and is thus advantageous once revealed. However, this facilitating role for cryptic variation has not been proven, partly because most pertinent work focuses on complex phenotypes of whole organisms whose genetic basis is incompletely understood. Here we show that populations of {RNA} enzymes with accumulated cryptic variation adapt more rapidly to a new substrate than a population without cryptic variation. A detailed analysis of our evolving {RNA} populations in genotype space shows that cryptic variation allows a population to explore new genotypes that become adaptive only in a new environment. Our observations show that cryptic variation contains new genotypes pre-adapted to a changed environment. Our results highlight the positive role that robustness and epistasis can have in adaptive evolution.},

	abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum-likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbc L sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This new method is implemented in the {PHYML} program, which is freely available on our web page: {http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/.}},

However, the clinical application of {CM} is greatly limited due to its low effects in vivo resulted from its poor solubility and pharmacokinetics. This raises the possibility of taking {CM} as a novel model drug in a new nanoparticle-based delivery system. In this study, {CM-loaded} nanoparticles were prepared from three kinds of amphilic methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) ({mPEG)–polycaprolactone} ({PCL)} block copolymers. It was noted that {CM-loaded} nanoparticles prepared from {mPEG10k–PCL30k} showed not only the highest loading efficiency, but also the most sustained release pattern. In vitro studies showed that {CM} was effectively transported into A549 cells by nanoparticles and localized around the nuclei in the cytoplasm. In addition, the cytotoxicity of {CM-loaded} nanoparticles with {mEPG10k–PCL30k} as a drug carrier was in a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549 cells. Further apoptotic staining results demonstrated the superior pro-apoptotic effect of {CM-loaded} nanoparticles over free drug. Data in this study not only confirmed the potential of {CM} in treating lung cancer, but also offered an effective way to improve the anticancer efficiency of {CM} through the nano-drug delivery system.},

Using the biotinylated {CAP} trapper method, we constructed full-length Arabidopsis {cDNA} libraries from plants in different conditions, such as drought-treated, cold-treated, or unstressed plants, and at various developmental stages from germination to mature seed. We prepared a {cDNA} microarray using ∼1300 full-length Arabidopsis {cDNAs} to identify drought- and cold-inducible genes and target genes of {DREB1A/CBF3}, a transcription factor that controls stress-inducible gene expression. In total, 44 and 19 {cDNAs} for drought- and cold-inducible genes, respectively, were isolated, 30 and 10 of which were novel stress-inducible genes that have not been reported as drought- or cold-inducible genes previously. Twelve stress-inducible genes were identified as target stress-inducible genes of {DREB1A}, and six of them were novel. On the basis of {RNA} gel blot and microarray analyses, the six genes were identified as novel drought- and cold-inducible genes that are controlled by {DREB1A.} Eleven {DREB1A} target genes whose genomic sequences have been registered in the {GenBank} database contained the dehydration-responsive element ({DRE)} or {DRE-related} {CCGAC} core motif in their promoter regions. These results show that our full-length {cDNA} microarray is a useful material with which to analyze the expression pattern of Arabidopsis genes under drought and cold stresses, to identify target genes of stress-related transcription factors, and to identify potential cis-acting {DNA} elements by combining the expression data with the genomic sequence data.},

The dataset incorporates over 3,700 annual observations covering a wide range of political systems, institutions, exchange rate arrangements, and historic circumstances. Our main findings are: First, the relationship between government debt and real {GDP} growth is weak for {debt/GDP} ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of {GDP.} Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We find that the threshold for public debt is similar in advanced and emerging economies. Second, emerging markets face lower thresholds for external debt (public and private)—which is usually denominated in a foreign currency. When external debt reaches 60 percent of {GDP}, annual growth declines by about two percent; for higher levels, growth rates are roughly cut in half. Third, there is no apparent contemporaneous link between inflation and public debt levels for the advanced countries as a group (some countries, such as the United States, have experienced higher inflation when {debt/GDP} is high.) The story is entirely different for emerging markets, where inflation rises sharply as debt increases.},

	abstract = {Under natural conditions, it is common for plants to experience water deprivation (drought) for periods of days or longer. Plants respond to drought stress by reconfiguring their transcriptome activity. Transcriptome changes in response to drought are dynamic, and are shaped by mitigating factors like time during the diurnal cycle. To date, analyses of drought-induced transcriptome remodelling have concentrated on dynamic changes induced by rapid desiccation, or changes at a single time point following gradual water stress. To gain insights into the dynamics of transcriptome reconfiguration in response to gradual drying of the soil, the drought-induced transcriptomes of Arabidopsis thaliana were examined at four time points over a single diel period – midday, late day, midnight, and pre-dawn. Transcriptome reconfigurations were induced by drought in advance of changes to relative water content, leaf water loss, and chlorophyll content. Comparative analyses support the hypothesis that the drought-responsive transcriptomes were shaped by invocation of distinct hormonal and stress response pathways at different times of the day. While a core set of genes were drought responsive at multiple time points throughout the day, the magnitude of the response varied in a manner dependent on the time of day. Moreover, analysis of a single time point would fail to identify suites of drought-responsive genes that can only be detected through assessment of the dynamics of diurnal changes, emphasising the value of characterising multiple time-of-day-specific drought transcriptomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
The structural response of photosystem {II} ({PSII)} and its light-harvesting proteins ({LHCII)} in Arabidopis thaliana after long-term acclimation to either high or low light intensity was characterized. Biochemical and structural analysis of isolated thylakoid membranes by electron microscopy indicates a distinctly different response at the level of {PSII} and {LHCII} upon plant acclimation. In high light acclimated plants, the {C2S2M2} supercomplex, which is the dominating form of {PSII} in Arabidopsis, is a major target of structural re-arrangement due to the down-regulation of Lhcb3 and Lhcb6 antenna proteins. The {PSII} ability to form semi-crystalline arrays in the grana membrane is strongly reduced compared to plants grown under optimal light conditions. This is due to the structural heterogeneity of {PSII} supercomplexes rather than to the action of {PsbS} protein as its level was unexpectedly reduced in high light acclimated plants. In low light acclimated plants, the architecture of the {C2S2M2} supercomplex and its ability to form semi-crystalline arrays remained unaffected but the density of {PSII} in grana membranes is reduced due to the synthesis of additional {LHCII} proteins. However, the {C2S2M2} supercomplexes in semi-crystalline arrays are more densely packed, which can be important for efficient energy transfer between {PSII} under light limiting conditions.},

	abstract = {In nature, plants encounter a combination of environmental conditions that may include stresses such as drought or heat shock. Although drought and heat shock have been extensively studied, little is known about how their combination affect plants. We used {cDNA} arrays, coupled with physiological measurements, to study the effect of drought and heat shock on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. A combination of drought and heat shock resulted in the closure of stomata, suppression of photosynthesis, enhancement of respiration, and increased leaf temperature. Some transcripts induced during drought, e.g. those encoding dehydrin, catalase, and glycolate oxidase, and some transcripts induced during heat shock, e.g. thioredoxin peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase, were suppressed during a combination of drought and heat shock. In contrast, the expression of other transcripts, including alternative oxidase, glutathione peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, pathogenesis-related proteins, a {WRKY} transcription factor, and an ethylene response transcriptional co-activator, was specifically induced during a combination of drought and heat shock. Photosynthetic genes were suppressed, whereas transcripts encoding some glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes were induced, suggesting the utilization of sugars through these pathways during stress. Our results demonstrate that the response of plants to a combination of drought and heat shock, similar to the conditions in many natural environments, is different from the response of plants to each of these stresses applied individually, as typically tested in the laboratory. This response was also different from the response of plants to other stresses such as cold, salt, or pathogen attack. Therefore, improving stress tolerance of plants and crops may require a reevaluation, taking into account the effect of multiple stresses on plant metabolism and defense.},

Research suggests that the plant response to multiple stresses is different from that for individual stresses, producing nonadditive effects. In particular, the molecular signaling pathways controlling biotic and abiotic stress responses may interact and antagonize one another. The transcriptome response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to concurrent water deficit (abiotic stress) and infection with the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii (biotic stress) was analyzed by microarray. A unique program of gene expression was activated in response to a combination of water deficit and nematode stress, with 50 specifically multiple-stress-regulated genes. Candidate genes with potential roles in controlling the response to multiple stresses were selected and functionally characterized. {RAPID} {ALKALINIZATION} {FACTOR-LIKE8} ({AtRALFL8)} was induced in roots by joint stresses but conferred susceptibility to drought stress and nematode infection when overexpressed. Constitutively expressing plants had stunted root systems and extended root hairs. Plants may produce signal peptides such as {AtRALFL8} to induce cell wall remodeling in response to multiple stresses. The methionine homeostasis gene {METHIONINE} {GAMMA} {LYASE} ({AtMGL)} was up-regulated by dual stress in leaves, conferring resistance to nematodes when overexpressed. It may regulate methionine metabolism under conditions of multiple stresses. {AZELAIC} {ACID} {INDUCED1} ({AZI1)}, involved in defense priming in systemic plant immunity, was down-regulated in leaves by joint stress and conferred drought susceptibility when overexpressed, potentially as part of abscisic acid-induced repression of pathogen response genes. The results highlight the complex nature of multiple stress responses and confirm the importance of studying plant stress factors in combination.},

	abstract = {Many plants, including Arabidopsis, increase in freezing tolerance in response to low, nonfreezing temperatures, a phenomenon known as cold acclimation. Previous studies established that cold acclimation involves rapid expression of the {CBF} transcriptional activators (also known as {DREB1} proteins) in response to low temperature followed by induction of the {CBF} regulon ({CBF-targeted} genes), which contributes to an increase in freezing tolerance. Here, we present the results of transcriptome-profiling experiments indicating the existence of multiple low-temperature regulatory pathways in addition to the {CBF} cold response pathway. The transcript levels of ∼8000 genes were determined at multiple times after plants were transferred from warm to cold temperature and in warm-grown plants that constitutively expressed {CBF1}, {CBF2}, or {CBF3.} A total of 306 genes were identified as being cold responsive, with transcripts for 218 genes increasing and those for 88 genes decreasing threefold or more at one or more time points during the 7-day experiment. These results indicate that extensive downregulation of gene expression occurs during cold acclimation. Of the cold-responsive genes, 48 encode known or putative transcription factors. Two of these, {RAP2.1} and {RAP2.6}, were activated by {CBF} expression and thus presumably control subregulons of the {CBF} regulon. Transcriptome comparisons indicated that only 12\% of the cold-responsive genes are certain members of the {CBF} regulon. Moreover, at least 28\% of the cold-responsive genes were not regulated by the {CBF} transcription factors, including 15 encoding known or putative transcription factors, indicating that these cold-responsive genes are members of different low-temperature regulons. Significantly, {CBF} expression at warm temperatures repressed the expression of eight genes that also were downregulated by low temperature, indicating that in addition to gene induction, gene repression is likely to play an integral role in cold acclimation.},

Absorption of light that exceeds a plant's capacity for fixation of {CO2} results in thermal dissipation of excitation energy in the pigment antenna of photosystem {II} by a poorly understood mechanism. This regulatory process, termed nonphotochemical quenching, maintains the balance between dissipation and utilization of light energy to minimize generation of oxidizing molecules, thereby protecting the plant against photo-oxidative damage. To identify specific proteins that are involved in nonphotochemical quenching, we have isolated mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that cannot dissipate excess absorbed light energy. Here we show that the gene encoding {PsbS}, an intrinsic chlorophyll-binding protein of photosystem {II}, is necessary for nonphotochemical quenching but not for efficient light harvesting and photosynthesis. These results indicate that {PsbS} may be the site for nonphotochemical quenching, a finding that has implications for the functional evolution of pigment-binding proteins.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest in the occurrence and molecular mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity and genotype-by-environment interactions ({G×E)} in plant populations. The emergence of genomic tools, including quantitative trait locus ({QTL)} mapping and transcriptome studies, provide opportunities to identify {G×E} patterns and mechanisms across a diversity of phenotypes, species, and environments. We review progress in evaluating the presence and characterizing the mechanisms of {G×E} using genomic studies of abiotic responses in plants. Our review reveals that {G×E} is common, often caused by changes in the magnitude of genetic effects in response to the environment, and associated with diverse genetic factors and molecular variants. We illustrate this diversity with an examination of transcriptome studies and discussion of cloned genes underlying {G×E.} We discuss the caveats associated with existing studies and outline future directions for better understanding {G×E} and its impact on local adaptation and plant improvement.

	abstract = {One of the most important problems in meteorology, physical oceanography, climatology, and related fields is the understanding and dynamical description of multi-scale interactions. Multi-scale interactions are closely related to extreme events in climate and, therefore, of great practical importance. Here an extreme event is defined in terms of the non-Gaussian tail (sometimes also called a weather or climate regime) of the data's probability density function ({PDF)}, as opposed to the definition in extreme value theory, where the statistics of time series maxima (and minima) in a given time interval are studied. The non-Gaussian approach used here allows for a dynamical view of extreme events in weather and climate, going beyond the solely mathematical arguments of extreme value theory. Extreme events are by definition scarce, but they can have a significant impact on people and countries in the affected regions. Understanding extremes has become an important objective in weather/climate variability research because weather and climate risk assessment depends on knowing the tails of {PDFs.} In recent years, new tools that make use of advanced stochastic theory have evolved to evaluate extreme events and the physics that govern these events. Stochastic methods are ideal to study multi-scale interactions and extreme events because they link vastly different time and spatial scales. One theory attributes extreme anomalies to stochastically forced dynamics, where, to model nonlinear interactions, the strength of the stochastic forcing depends on the flow itself (multiplicative noise). This closure assumption follows naturally from the general form of the equations of motion. Because stochastic theory makes clear and testable predictions about non-Gaussian variability, the multiplicative noise hypothesis can be verified by analyzing the detailed non-Gaussian statistics of atmospheric and oceanic variability. This review paper discusses the theoretical framework, observational evidence, and related developments in stochastic modeling of extreme events in weather and climate. © 2011 Elsevier {B.V.}},

The {CBF} transcription factors were the first transcriptional activators demonstrated to have a role in controlling the expression of cold-responsive genes with a role in cold acclimation.

Many plants increase their freezing tolerance during exposure to low, nonfreezing temperatures (cold acclimation) and acclimation may continue at mild freezing temperatures in a process termed sub-zero acclimation. There is considerable natural variation in the cold acclimation capacity of Arabidopsis that has been used to study the molecular basis of this trait, but much less is known about the molecular basis of sub-zero acclimation. Freezing tolerance of detached leaves from the accessions C24, Columbia-0, Rschew, and Tenela was investigated using an electrolyte leakage assay. Sub-zero acclimation could be achieved by shifting plants from 4 {°C} to −3 {°C}, or by using detached leaves, either in the presence or absence of ice nucleation. The magnitude of the increase in freezing tolerance depended on both temperature and duration of sub-zero acclimation and while Columbia-0 showed no significant increase in freezing tolerance, the other three accessions increased their freezing tolerance significantly. The levels of several sugars that have been shown to be induced during cold acclimation at nonfreezing temperatures were not strongly changed during sub-zero acclimation and there was no correlation between the increases in freezing tolerance and sugar levels in the different accessions. Expression of the three cold induced {CBF} transcription factor genes and five of their representative target {COR} genes was moderately increased during sub-zero acclimation, but again there was no correlation to changes in freezing tolerance, indicating that the genetic and molecular basis of sub-zero acclimation is most likely different from that of cold acclimation at above freezing temperatures. Further studies will be needed to reveal novel signal transduction pathways and protective mechanisms important in sub-zero acclimation.},

	abstract = {Arabidopsis seedlings are highly sensitive to low oxygen and they die rapidly when exposed to anoxia. Tolerance to anoxia depends on the ability to efficiently use carbohydrates through the fermentative pathway, as highlighted by the lower tolerance displayed by a mutant devoid of alcohol dehydrogenase. Other mechanisms of tolerance are also possible and may include a role for heat-induced genes. In fact, heat shock proteins ({HSPs)} are induced by anoxia. This suggests that there may be a cross-adaptation mechanism between heat and anoxic stress, and in this work, we studied the acclimation of Arabidopsis seedlings both to low oxygen and heat. The results show that seedlings subjected to hypoxia or heat pretreatment survive anoxia much better. Interestingly, we also observed an increased anoxia tolerance in heat-treated alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) mutant plants. On the other hand, anoxic pretreatment does not confer tolerance to heat stress. The success of the induction of {HSPs} by anoxia is in direct relation to the amount of sucrose available, and this in turn relates to how well seedlings will survive under anoxia. {HSP} transcripts were also detected during seed development and germination, two hypoxia-prone processes, suggesting that hypoxia-induced {HSP} expression is physiologically relevant.},

	abstract = {Abstract When resources are limited, there is a trade-off between growth/reproduction and stress defense in plants. Most temperate plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, can enhance freezing tolerance through cold acclimation at low but nonfreezing temperatures. Induction of the cold acclimation pathway should be beneficial in environments where plants frequently encounter freezing stress, but it might represent a cost in environments where freezing events are rare. In A. thaliana, induction of the cold acclimation pathway critically involves a small subfamily of genes known as the {CBFs.} Here we test for a cost of cold acclimation by utilizing (1) natural accessions of A. thaliana that originate from different regions of the species’ native range and that have experienced different patterns of historical selection on their {CBF} genes and (2) transgenic {CBF} overexpression and T-{DNA} insertion (knockdown/knockout) lines. While benefits of cold acclimation in the presence of freezing stress were confirmed, no cost of cold acclimation was detected in the absence of freezing stress. These findings suggest that cold acclimation is unlikely to be selected against in warmer environments and that naturally occurring mutations disrupting {CBF} function in the southern part of the species range are likely to be selectively neutral. An unanticipated finding was that cold acclimation in the absence of a subsequent freezing stress resulted in increased fruit production, that is, fitness.},

	abstract = {In plants, low temperature and dehydration activate a set of genes containing C-repeat/dehydration-responsive elements in their promoter. It has been shown previously that the Arabidopsis {CBF/DREB1} transcription activators are critical regulators of gene expression in the signal transduction of cold acclimation. Here, we report the isolation of an apparent homolog of the {CBF/DREB1} proteins ({CBF4)} that plays the equivalent role during drought adaptation. In contrast to the three already identified {CBF/DREB1} homologs, which are induced under cold stress, {CBF4} gene expression is up-regulated by drought stress, but not by low temperature. Overexpression of {CBF4} in transgenic Arabidopsis plants results in the activation of C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element containing downstream genes that are involved in cold acclimation and drought adaptation. As a result, the transgenic plants are more tolerant to freezing and drought stress. Because of the physiological similarity between freezing and drought stress, and the sequence and structural similarity of the {CBF/DREB1} and the {CBF4} proteins, we propose that the plant's response to cold and drought evolved from a common {CBF-like} transcription factor, first through gene duplication and then through promoter evolution.
To study the regulatory and functional differentiation between the mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath ({BS)} cells of maize (Zea mays), we isolated large quantities of highly homogeneous M and {BS} cells from newly matured second leaves for transcriptome profiling by {RNA} sequencing. A total of 52,421 annotated genes with at least one read were found in the two transcriptomes. Defining a gene with more than one read per kilobase per million mapped reads as expressed, we identified 18,482 expressed genes; 14,972 were expressed in M cells, including 53 M-enriched transcription factor ({TF)} genes, whereas 17,269 were expressed in {BS} cells, including 214 {BS-enriched} {TF} genes. Interestingly, many {TF} gene families show a conspicuous {BS} preference in expression. Pathway analyses reveal differentiation between the two cell types in various functional categories, with the M cells playing more important roles in light reaction, protein synthesis and folding, tetrapyrrole synthesis, and {RNA} binding, while the {BS} cells specialize in transport, signaling, protein degradation and posttranslational modification, major carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen metabolism, cell division and organization, and development. Genes coding for several transporters involved in the shuttle of C4 metabolites and {BS} cell wall development have been identified, to our knowledge, for the first time. This comprehensive data set will be useful for studying {M/BS} differentiation in regulation and function.},

	abstract = {Drought at the reproductive stage is a major constraint to pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] productivity. Quantitative trait locus ({QTL)} mapping provides a means to dissect complex traits, such as drought tolerance, into their components, each of which is controlled by {QTLs.} Molecular marker-supported genotypic information at the identified {QTLs} then enables quick and accurate accumulation of desirable alleles in plant breeding programmes. Recent genetic mapping research in pearl millet has mapped several {QTLs} for grain yield and its components under terminal drought stress conditions. Most importantly, a major {QTL} associated with grain yield and for the drought tolerance of grain yield in drought stress environments has been identified on linkage group 2 ({LG} 2) which accounts for up to 32\% of the phenotypic variation of grain yield in mapping population testcrosses. The effect of this {QTL} has been validated in two independent marker-assisted backcrossing programmes, where 30\% improvement in grain yield general combining ability ({GCA)} expected of this {QTL} under terminal drought stress conditions was recovered in the {QTL} introgression lines. To transfer effectively favourable alleles of this {QTL} into pearl millet varieties that otherwise are high yielding and adapted to specific agricultural zones, efforts are currently underway to develop closely spaced gene-based markers within this drought tolerance ({DT)-QTL.} In this review, an overview is provided of information on the genetic maps developed in pearl millet for mapping drought tolerance traits and their applications in identifying and characterizing {DT-QTLs.} Marker-assisted transfer of desirable {QTL} alleles to elite parent backgrounds, and results from introgression line validation in multiple terminal drought stress environments are discussed. Current efforts undertaken towards delimiting the interval of a major {DT-QTL} mapping to {LG} 2, and towards identifying candidate genes and physiologies underlying this {QTL} are presented. Highly specialized genetic stocks [{QTL-near-isogenic} lines ({NILs)}, a high-resolution cross, and a germplasm population] and genomic resources (gene sequences, gene-based markers, and comparative genomics information) specifically developed for these purposes are discussed.},

Sequence analysis showed that {OsAP21} contained an {AP2/ERF} domain of 57 amino acids. By comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of {AP2/ERF-related} proteins, we deduced that {OsAP21} is a transcription factor gene, which belonging to rice {AP2/ERF} family {CBF/DREB} subfamily. Further, we report that transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the {OsAP21} gene exhibited stronger growth than wild type plants under salt/drought stress. Analysis of {RT-PCR} for {RD29B} gene implied that {OsAP21} over-expressed plants had a higher expression level of {RD29B} gene than wild type plants, and drought and salt treatments could enlarge these differences. Collectively, our results indicate that {OsAP21} may play an important role in the response of transgenic Arabidopsis plants to salt/drought stresses.},

	abstract = {Aquaporins facilitate water transport over cellular membranes, and are therefore believed to play an important role in water homeostasis. In higher plants aquaporin-like proteins, also called major intrinsic proteins ({MIPs)}, are divided into five subfamilies. We have previously shown that {MIP} transcription in Arabidopsis thaliana is generally downregulated in leaves upon drought stress, apart from two members of the plasma membrane intrinsic protein ({PIP)} subfamily, {AtPIP1;4} and {AtPIP2;5}, which are upregulated. In order to assess whether this regulation is general or accession-specific we monitored the gene expression of all {PIPs} in five Arabidopsis accessions. The overall drought regulation of {PIPs} was well conserved for all five accessions tested, suggesting a general and fundamental physiological role of this drought response. In addition, significant differences among accessions were identified for transcripts of three {PIP} genes. Principal component analysis showed that most of the {PIP} transcriptional variation during drought stress could be explained by one variable linked to leaf water content. Promoter-{GUS} constructs of {AtPIP1;4}, {AtPIP2;5} and also {AtPIP2;6}, which is unresponsive to drought stress, had distinct expression patterns concentrated in the base of the leaf petioles and parts of the flowers. The presence of drought stress response elements within the 1.6-kb promoter regions of {AtPIP1;4} and {AtPIP2;5} was demonstrated by comparing transcription of the promoter reporter construct and the endogenous gene upon drought stress. Analysis by {ATTED-II} and other web-based bioinformatical tools showed that several of the {MIPs} downregulated upon drought are strongly co-expressed, whereas {AtPIP1;4}, {AtPIP2;5} and {AtPIP2;6} are not co-expressed.},

	abstract = {A complex phenotype such as seed germination is the result of several genetic and environmental cues and requires the concerted action of many genes. The use of well-structured recombinant inbred lines in combination with “omics” analysis can help to disentangle the genetic basis of such quantitative traits. This so-called genetical genomics approach can effectively capture both genetic and epistatic interactions. However, to understand how the environment interacts with genomic-encoded information, a better understanding of the perception and processing of environmental signals is needed. In a classical genetical genomics setup, this requires replication of the whole experiment in different environmental conditions. A novel generalized setup overcomes this limitation and includes environmental perturbation within a single experimental design. We developed a dedicated quantitative trait loci mapping procedure to implement this approach and used existing phenotypical data to demonstrate its power. In addition, we studied the genetic regulation of primary metabolism in dry and imbibed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. In the metabolome, many changes were observed that were under both environmental and genetic controls and their interaction. This concept offers unique reduction of experimental load with minimal compromise of statistical power and is of great potential in the field of systems genetics, which requires a broad understanding of both plasticity and dynamic regulation.},

Applications include generating genomic data for heretofore unsequenced species, thus expanding the boundaries of what had been considered “model organisms,” elucidating structural and regulatory gene networks, revealing how plants respond to developmental cues and their environment, allowing a better understanding of the relationships between genes and their products, and uniting the “omics” fields of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics into a now common systems biology paradigm.

The Q10 is often assumed to be 2.0 (i.e. R doubles per {10°C} rise in temperature); however, the Q10 is not constant (e.g. it declines near-linearly with increasing temperature). The temperature dependence of Q10 is linked to shifts in the control exerted by maximum enzyme activity at low temperature and substrate limitations at high temperature. In the long term, acclimation of R to temperature is common, in effect reducing the temperature sensitivity of R to changes in thermal environment, with the temperature during plant development setting the maximal thermal acclimation of R.},
