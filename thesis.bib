	abstract = {In plants, reactive oxygen species and, more particularly, hydrogen peroxide ({H2O2)} play a dual role as toxic by-products of normal cell metabolism and as regulatory molecules in stress perception and signal
         transduction. Peroxisomal catalases are an important sink for photorespiratory {H2O2.} Using {ATH1} Affymetrix microarrays, expression profiles were compared between control and catalase-deficient Arabidopsis
         (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Reduced catalase levels already provoked differences in nuclear gene expression under ambient growth conditions,
         and these effects were amplified by high light exposure in a sun simulator for 3 and 8 h. This genome-wide expression analysis
         allowed us to reveal the expression characteristics of complete pathways and functional categories during {H2O2} stress. In total, 349 transcripts were significantly up-regulated by high light in catalase-deficient plants and 88 were
         down-regulated. From this data set, {H2O2} was inferred to play a key role in the transcriptional up-regulation of small heat shock proteins during high light stress.
         In addition, several transcription factors and candidate regulatory genes involved in {H2O2} transcriptional gene networks were identified. Comparisons with other publicly available transcriptome data sets of abiotically
         stressed Arabidopsis revealed an important intersection with {H2O2-deregulated} genes, positioning elevated {H2O2} levels as an important signal within abiotic stress-induced gene expression. Finally, analysis of transcriptional changes
         in a combination of a genetic (catalase deficiency) and an environmental (high light) perturbation identified a transcriptional
         cluster that was strongly and rapidly induced by high light in control plants, but impaired in catalase-deficient plants.
         This cluster comprises the complete known anthocyanin regulatory and biosynthetic pathway, together with genes encoding unknown
         proteins.},

Microarray and northern-blot analyses were performed toward the identification of the factors and signaling pathways that enable plants to limit oxidative damage caused by exposure to high light ({HL).} Arabidopsis plants grown under moderate light (100 μmol m−2 s−1) were exposed to {HL} (1,000 μmol m−2 s−1) for 1 h. The microarray analyses revealed that exposure of Arabidopsis to {HL} caused an increase in known antioxidant genes, as well as several unknown genes. Some of these unknown genes had homologies to possible regulatory genes and metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, it was found that a range of chaperones were up-regulated in the {HL} treatment and that this induction was specifically due to the {HL} stress. The temporal expression under {HL} and different oxidative stress conditions of a subset of {HL-responsive} genes was confirmed via northern-blot analysis. Results from the arrays were also compared with publicly available microarray data sets from a range of different stress conditions at the Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Consortium. This cross comparison enabled the identification of genes that may be induced by changes in redox poise. Finally, to determine if the genes that were differentially expressed by {HL} stress were under similar transcriptional control, we analyzed the promoter sequences for the presence of common motifs.},

	abstract = {The mobile part of the light-harvesting chlorophyll (chl) a/b protein complex ({LHCII)}, composed of the Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 proteins, is the basic unit of chloroplast state transitions—the short term tuning system in balancing the excitation energy between Photosystem ({PS)} {II} and {PSI.} State transitions are catalysed by the thylakoid associated {STN7} kinase, and we show here that besides the phosphorylation of the Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 proteins, also the phosphorylation of Lhcb4.2 ({CP29)} is under the control of the {STN7} kinase. Upon growth of Arabidopsis {WT} and stn7 mutant plants under low and moderate light conditions, the {WT} plants favoured state 2 whereas stn7 was locked in state 1. The lack of the {STN7} kinase and state transitions in stn7 also modified the thylakoid protein contents upon long-term low light acclimation resulting, for example, in low Lhcb1 and in elevated Lhca1 and Lhca2 protein amounts as compared to {WT.} Adjustments of thylakoid protein contents probably occurred at post-transcriptional level since the {DNA} microarray experiments from each growth condition did not reveal any significant differences between stn7 and {WT} transcriptomes. The resulting high {Lhcb2/Lhcb1} ratio in stn7 upon growth at low light was accompanied by lower capacity for {NPQ} than in {WT.} On the contrary, higher amounts of {PsbS} in stn7 under moderate and high light growth conditions resulted in higher {NPQ} compared to {WT} and consequently also in a protection of {PSII} against photoinhibition. {STN7} kinase and the state transitions are suggested to have a physiological significance for dynamic acclimation to low but fluctuating growth light conditions. They are shown to function as a buffering system upon short high light illumination peaks by shifting the thylakoids from state 2 to state 1 and thereby down regulating the induction of stress-responsive genes, a likely result from transient over-reduction of {PSI} acceptors.},

	abstract = {Photoinhibition is an inevitable consequence of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, the concept of a ‘photoinhibition-proof’ plant in which photosystem {II} ({PSII)} is immune to photodamage is useful as a benchmark for considering the performances of plants with varying mixes of mechanisms which limit the extent of photodamage and which repair photodamage. Some photodamage is bound to occur, and the energy costs of repair are the direct costs of repair plus the photosynthesis foregone during repair. One mechanism permitting partial avoidance of photodamage is restriction of the number of photons incident on the photosynthetic apparatus per unit time, achieved by phototactic movement of motile algae to places with lower incident photosynthetically active radiation ({PAR)}, by phototactic movement of plastids within cells to positions that minimize the incident {PAR} and by photonastic relative movements of parts of photolithotrophs attached to a substrate. The other means of avoiding photodamage is dissipating excitation of photosynthetic pigments including state transitions, non-photochemical quenching by one of the xanthophyll cycles or some other process and photochemical quenching by increased electron flow through {PSII} involving {CO2} and other acceptors, including the engagement of additional electron transport pathways. These mechanisms inevitably have the potential to decrease the rate of growth. As well as the decreased photosynthetic rates as a result of photodamage and the restrictions on photosynthesis imposed by the repair, avoidance, quenching and scavenging mechanisms, there are also additional energy, nitrogen and phosphorus costs of producing and operating repair, avoidance, quenching and scavenging mechanisms. A comparison is also made between the costs of photoinhibition and those of other plant functions impeded by the occurrence of oxygenic photosynthesis, i.e. the competitive inhibition of the carboxylase activity of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase by oxygen via the oxygenase activity, and oxygen damage to nitrogenase in diazotrophic organisms.},

Paradoxically, sunlight damages the photosynthetic machinery, primarily photosystem {II} ({PSII)}, leading to photoinhibition and loss of plant performance. However, there is uncertainty about which wavelengths are most damaging to {PSII} under sunlight. In this work we examined this in a simple experiment where Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves were exposed to different wavelengths of sunlight by dispersing the solar radiation across the surface of the leaf via a prism. To isolate only the process of photodamage, the repair of photodamaged {PSII} was inhibited by infiltration of chloramphenicol into the exposed leaves. The extent of photodamage was then measured as the decrease in the maximum quantum yield of {PSII} using an imaging pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer. Under the experimental light conditions, photodamage to {PSII} occurred most strongly in regions exposed to ultraviolet ({UV)} or yellow light. The extent of {UV} photodamage under incident sunlight would be greater than we observed when one corrects for the optical efficiency of our system. Our results suggest that photodamage to {PSII} under sunlight is primarily associated with {UV} rather than photosynthetically active light wavelengths.},

	abstract = {Cyclic electron flow ({CEF)} around photosystem I has a role in avoiding photoinhibition of photosystem {II} ({PSII)}, which occurs under conditions in which the rate of photodamage to {PSII} exceeds the rate of its repair. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how {CEF} contributes to photoprotection is not yet well understood. We examined the effect of impairment of {CEF} and thermal energy dissipation ({qE)} on photoinhibition using {CEF} (pgr5) and {qE} (npq1 and npq4) mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) exposed to strong light. Impairment of {CEF} by mutation of pgr5 suppressed {qE} and accelerated photoinhibition. We found that impairment of {qE}, by mutations of pgr5, npq1, and npq4, caused inhibition of the repair of photodamaged {PSII} at the step of the de novo synthesis of the D1 protein. In the presence of the chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol, impairment of {CEF}, but not impairment of {qE}, accelerated photoinhibition, and a similar effect was obtained when leaves were infiltrated with the protonophore nigericin. These results suggest that {CEF-dependent} generation of {ΔpH} across the thylakoid membrane helps to alleviate photoinhibition by at least two different photoprotection mechanisms: one is linked to {qE} generation and prevents the inhibition of the repair of photodamaged {PSII} at the step of protein synthesis, and the other is independent of {qE} and suppresses photodamage to {PSII.}},

Heat stress in nature is frequently accompanied by high light, and photoinhibition is a major limitation for photosynthesis. Light induction of {HSPs} may help ameliorate damage from excess light. In this study, we asked if accumulation of representative {HSPs} differed in naturally occurring Solidago altissima (goldenrod) in contrasting light microclimates (open sun vs. shade) and on cool vs. warm days. Our results show that {HSP} content in field-grown plants, undergoing natural temperature stress, was greater in open sun than shaded environments. Supporting these results, both light and temperature significantly affected accumulation of {HSPs} in the laboratory.

Typical sun/shade differences in chloroplast composition are seen in the fifth leaf following growth in high irradiance compared with low irradiance (1000 and 200 μmol m−2 s−1, respectively): higher light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (Pmax), higher amounts of Rubisco protein, and a lower chlorophyll a:b ratio. In addition, leaves were thicker under high light compared with low light. However, responses appear more complex when leaf developmental stage is considered. Using a system of transferring plants from low to high light in the laboratory responses that occur before and after full leaf extension have been studied. Acclimation of photosynthesis is limited by leaf age: the transfer to high light, post-leaf extension, is characterized by alterations in chlorophyll a:b but not in Rubisco protein, which may be limited by leaf morphology. Microarray analysis of gene expression was carried out on plants that were transferred to high light post-leaf extension. A down-regulation of light-harvesting genes was seen. No change in the expression level of Rubisco genes was observed. Up-regulation of genes involved in photoprotection was observed. It was also shown that high-light leaf morphology is established prior to formation of the zone of cellular elongation and division. The endogenous and environmental factors which establish the characteristics of high light acclimation may be important for attaining high rates of assimilation in leaves and crop canopies, and the fifth leaf in rice provides a convenient model system for the determination of the mechanisms involved.},

Here, we report an investigation into the structural basis of light-harvesting regulation in intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts using freeze-fracture electron microscopy, combined with laser confocal microscopy employing the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. The results demonstrate that formation of the photoprotective state requires a structural reorganization of the photosynthetic membrane involving dissociation of {LHCII} from {PSII} and its aggregation. The structural changes are manifested by a reduced mobility of {LHC} antenna chlorophyll proteins. It is demonstrated that these changes occur rapidly and reversibly within 5 min of illumination and dark relaxation, are dependent on {ΔpH}, and are enhanced by the deepoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin.},

	abstract = {When plants are exposed to light levels higher than those required for photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species are generated in the chloroplasts and cause photodamage. This can occur even under natural growth conditions. To mitigate photodamage, plants have developed several protective mechanisms. One is chloroplast avoidance movement, in which chloroplasts move from the cell surface to the side walls of cells under high light conditions, although experimental support is still awaited. Here, using different classes of mutant defective in chloroplast avoidance movement, we show that these mutants are more susceptible to damage in high light than wild-type plants. Damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and subsequent bleaching of leaf colour and necrosis occur faster under high light conditions in the mutants than in wild-type plants. We conclude that chloroplast avoidance movement actually decreases the amount of light absorption by chloroplasts, and might therefore be important to the survival of plants under natural growth conditions.},

	abstract = {We examined the effect of manipulating photosystem {II} ({PSII)} redox poise on respiratory flux in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. Measurements were made on wild-type ({WT)} plants and npq4 mutant plants deficient in non-photochemical quenching ({NPQ).} Two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, {WT} and mutant warm-grown plants were exposed to three different irradiance regimes [75, 150 and 300 µmol photosynthetically active radiation ({PAR)]}, and leaf dark respiration was measured in conjunction with {PSII} redox poise. In the second experiment, {WT} and mutant warm-grown plants were shifted to 5 {°C} and 75, 150 or 300 µmol {PAR}, and dark respiration was measured alongside {PSII} redox poise in cold-treated and cold-developed leaves. Despite significant differences in {PSII} redox poise between genotypes and irradiance treatments, neither genotype nor growth irradiance had any effect upon the rate of respiration in warm-grown, cold-treated or cold-developed leaves. We conclude that changes in {PSII} redox poise, at least within the range experienced here, have no direct impacts on rates of leaf dark respiration, and that the respiratory cold acclimation response is unrelated to changes in chloroplast redox poise.},

	abstract = {Chloroplasts of leaves under high light stress initiate signals to the nuclei of both exposed and distal leaves in order to acclimate against the potential threat of oxidative damage: a process known as high light systemic acquired acclimation ({HL} {SAA).} This study explores the nature of {HL} {SAA}, synergistic interactions with other environmental stresses, and the impact of repeated {HL} stress on the acclimation response of exposed and distal leaves. This necessitated the development of novel experimental systems to investigate the initiation, perception, and response to {HL} {SAA.} These systems were used to investigate the {HL} {SAA} response by monitoring the induction of {mRNA} in distal leaves not exposed to the {HL} stress. Acclimation to {HL} is induced within minutes and the response is proportionally dependent on the quality and quantity of light. {HL} {SAA} treatments in conjunction with variations in temperature and humidity reveal {HL} {SAA} is influenced by fluctuations in humidity. These treatments also result in changes in auxin accumulation and auxin-responsive genes. A key question in retrograde signaling is the extent to which transient changes in light intensity result in a “memory” of the event leading to acclimation responses. Repeated exposure to short term {HL} resulted in acclimation of the exposed tissue and that of emerging and young leaves (but not older leaves) to {HL} and oxidative stress.},
