    Notes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Code listings, where included, are illustrative. Full source code of all software
        developed is large (over 5000 lines of code), and will be distrubuted as a gzipped tar
        archive. The latest code for all pipleines, scrips, and even this thesis, is available
        online. See Appendix \autoref{sec:appendix-sourcecoderepos} and
